1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,616
This programme
contains some strong language.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,256
I'm driving to the Himalayas.
I never know when to tell you stuff.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,216
Where've these come from?
Didn't recognise me.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,416
How many times have I stood near
that football field?

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,696
Have you had your oats, sir?

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,336
He's going to chase us!
TYRES SCREECH

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,576
He found some of the pills that
you've given me.

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,256
You're a Good Samaritan, Mr Bhatti.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,256
I mean, it's me
you need to worry about now.

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,616
We run these postcodes round here,
not you. Do you understand?

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,296
Revenge is a dish best served cold.
Who's taught you that?!

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,136
This prison officer
had seen Ryan visiting Royce.

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,816
He was with a man and a woman.

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,720
A man and a woman?

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,136
What?

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,160
Got some intel for you
from the prison in Sheffield.

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,480
You're not going to like it.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,456
It's Clare.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,496
It's your Clare.

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,056
And Neil Ackroyd.

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,680
Is that her partner?
Neil Ackroyd?

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,976
Looks like they started
visiting him just over a year ago.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,936
There's been four visits,

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,336
and another one arranged for
this Saturday.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,616
This coming Saturday, 2pm.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,016
You all right?

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,520
Catherine?

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,680
Speak to me.

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,496
Catherine.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,800
Why?

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,760
Why would they do that?

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,000
Why would Clare...?

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,640
What will you do?

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,280
Saturdays.

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,176
All Saturdays when they've been
taking him to his football,

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,520
and I've been working.

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,080
You think you know people.

38
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,976
How... how?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,120
How...?

40
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,816
How's he got in touch with
our Ryan in the first place?

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,336
Does Royce know your address?
Yeah.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,056
When he got that Frances Wealand
Drummond,

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,256
whatever her name was,
to bring that Scalextric.

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,696
But I'd have... No, I'd have
seen something, a letter,

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,176
if it'd come to our house.
Ryan never gets any post

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,016
and when he does,
he never bothers to open it.

47
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,920
Well, does Royce know their
address? Clare and Neil's?

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,400
How?

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,240
And how could Ryan
have got in touch with him?

50
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,096
How could he have known
he'd moved prisons?

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,056
I didn't know
he'd moved prisons.

52
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,720
I don't know.

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,536
Four times.
All within this last year.

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,256
Nothing before that.

55
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,616
I've never liked that Neil.
He's spineless.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,696
And Clare, for God's sake.

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,360
You see, she's the same.
Is she? Weak.

58
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,776
What am I going to do?

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,240
Well, you're not overreacting,
which is good.

60
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,336
Shit.

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,976
Can I do anything?

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,376
No.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
Do you want to go home? No.

64
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,040
I might ask for this Saturday
off, though.

65
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,416
What are you doing?

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,216
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,696
That's your...
Is that your lock?

68
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,200
No, this is my lock.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,856
Some dickhead's
chained us bikes together. What?

70
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,816
Ah, boys, there you are.

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,976
You not racing off today?

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,096
Somebody's chained
us bikes together... sir.

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,640
Oh, what a shame.

74
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,976
So, while you're here,
you're both in detention.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,016
What for? Did you do this? You know
perfectly well what for. A week.

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,816
Lunchtime detention.
What have I done?

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,456
I'm not arguing about it.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,856
It was him. I never said owt.
I was just with him.

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,216
And yet... Oh, yeah!

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,336
You ran off.

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,016
Because you were chasing us
in your car.

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,016
Look, I have warned you before

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,936
about what thin ice you are
skating on, motormouth.

84
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,416
So if I were you, I'd shut it.

85
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,976
Take your punishment like a man.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,536
I know it's a bit of a leap,

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,776
but use this in future to think
about what comes out of this.

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,936
Piss off, you twat!
What did you say?

89
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,816
Talking to us
like six-year-olds.

90
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,576
Maybe it's because you behave like
you're six year old!

91
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,136
Yeah, up your arse. Right, that's
it! You're off the football team!

92
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,536
You can't do that, sir!

93
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,616
Good. I don't care. I've resigned
off it anyway cos it's shit!

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,696
I'm not having that!
You come back here now!

95
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,536
It was me, sir. Yesterday.

96
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,176
I said it. Punish me!

97
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,456
It's not even worth being on! It's
the shittest team I've ever seen!

98
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,376
You just can't stop yourself,
can you?

99
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,856
They play like a load of little
girls! It's an embarrassment!

100
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,496
You can't kick him
off the football team, sir.

101
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,016
It's the only thing
he's any good at!

102
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,856
Do you not want your bike
back, then, Cawood?

103
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,960
Swivel!

104
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,216
What have I done to him?!
SMASHING AND CRASHING

105
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,936
Right. It sounds like his
bookshelf's just gone over,

106
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,976
so... that'll be that little
telly you gave him smashed.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,256
NEIL: I'd come round and help, but
there's only me and Lexie on

108
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,496
till Marie turns up.

109
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,936
No, you're all right.
I just wanted to share the joy.

110
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,616
I don't know exactly
what's gone on,

111
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,816
but I think that games
teacher's a funny beggar.

112
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,096
May well be.

113
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,256
But if it is escalating
and our Ryan's

114
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,896
saying stuff he shouldn't,

115
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,376
then he is going to get into bother.

116
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,776
CLATTERING UPSTAIRS
SHE SIGHS, RYAN YELLS

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,496
He's trying to get t'door
off its hinges now.

118
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,056
You want to put him on?
I'll try and have

119
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,456
a quick word with him. No, he's...
He won't come to t'phone.

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,680
He hasn't threatened
to hurt you, has he? No!

121
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,696
He's called me
a drug-addled piss artist,

122
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,696
but I'm trying not
to take it personally.

123
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,016
I'm trying to remind myself

124
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,776
that it's the anger speaking
and not

125
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,856
him just being
a repulsive little shit.

126
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,096
Love, I'm going to have to go.

127
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,936
As soon as Marie gets here,
I'll phone you,

128
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,976
and if you want me to pop round,

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,776
I will. OK.

130
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,496
RYAN: What have I done?!
HE SCREAMS

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,560
Bye.

132
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,360
MUSIC PLAYS,
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

133
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,600
ANISHA LAUGHS

134
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,296
Mm-hm. Can we bring anything?

135
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,016
Can we bring the dessert?

136
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,616
Oh, hang on.

137
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,856
Are we all right to go
to Zainab and Farhan's

138
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,416
on Friday evening? They got
the decking finished.

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,816
15 grand.

140
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,736
Yeah, we'll be there.
Hi, Dad. Hiya. You all right?

141
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,176
Just figuring out how I'm going to
pay for the new decking

142
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,136
your mother will be requiring
shortly. How come?

143
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,976
Probably just as soon as
she comes off the phone.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,816
Even though there's nothing
wrong with the deck...

145
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,456
Her sister's got some.
Auntie Zainab? Cool!

146
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,616
There is water in the tap,
you know.

147
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,616
What? Nothing. Yeah, but it doesn't
taste t'same.

148
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,496
It does! It's water.
It tastes exactly the...

149
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,880
QUIETLY: ..same...

150
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,720
ANISHA: Great! Mm-hm.

151
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
RICHARD: Clare and Neil? No way.

152
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,240
What are you going to do?

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,896
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

154
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,096
Could it be...

155
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,136
Well, not them?

156
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,336
Somebody using their names
for some reason?

157
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,376
I don't know. Yeah, well,
I wondered that, but no.

158
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,536
Every visit's coincided with
when I've been working Saturdays,

159
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,656
so, no, it'd be too much
of a coincidence. It's them.

160
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,416
You know, and this is
the bloke that's up in court

161
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,336
next week for another murder,
and Clare knows that.

162
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,536
We've even talked about it.

163
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,976
Ask her.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,376
No. No, I'm not going to ask
any of them anything.

165
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,656
I'm going to watch them.
I'm going to observe.

166
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,016
And come Saturday,
I'm going to follow 'em,

167
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,576
and... I don't know.
I don't know.

168
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,096
I don't know.

169
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,896
You can't avoid 'em.

170
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,416
Well, I can't avoid 'em,
you're right.

171
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,896
She's in there. She rang me,
and that's another saga.

172
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,616
He's had a spat with
his bloody games teacher

173
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,800
and got himself chucked off
his football team.

174
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,576
Is that that Gary Gackowski murder

175
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,696
Royce is in court for next week?

176
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,216
Yeah. Why?
What do you know about it?

177
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,560
Oh, it's just... something
I'm working on.

178
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,056
You're around tomorrow?

179
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,616
Well, I'm working, but I can be.

180
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,016
Why?

181
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,616
Want to meet up?

182
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,576
For a cup of tea or something.

183
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,736
Catch up...

184
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,856
..properly.

185
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,960
Yeah, can do.

186
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
TV IN BACKGROUND

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,936
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

188
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,320
Come on. Bed.

189
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,160
CLARE: Hiya.

190
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,776
Why aren't you in bed?

191
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,856
It's five to 11.
He's got school tomorrow.

192
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,296
I've been kicked off
t'football team

193
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,576
for something I didn't even do.

194
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,536
So I understand, and then you
trashed your bedroom. He did, yeah.

195
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,376
But we've tidied most of it up now,
so... Oh, have you? Oh, good.

196
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,416
Well, that'll teach him.
That's a good message.

197
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,216
Trash your bedroom
and your Auntie Clare'll

198
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,016
tidy it up for you. I helped him

199
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,176
because he calmed down
and then he apologised.

200
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,096
So, what's happened, then?

201
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,096
Hepworth. He's a twat.
Oh, swearing!

202
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,696
So if I ring Mr Baines
in the morning

203
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,296
and if I ask for an
appointment with him,

204
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,336
we explain what's happened,
that you've had a spat

205
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,680
with Mr Hepworth, that's going to be
your defence, is it?

206
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,816
He's a twat?

207
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,696
He's chased us in his car,
on us bikes.

208
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,616
And then he's chucked me
off t'team. For nothing? Yeah.

209
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,776
Cesco shouted, "Have you
had your oats, sir?"

210
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,096
which is what started it, but...

211
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,536
Yeah. And nothing else was said?

212
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,376
Yeah... Well, yeah,

213
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,856
quite a lot else was said,
but I didn't start it.

214
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,800
I DEFINITELY didn't start it.

215
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,040
I can't think about this now.
Go to bed. Yeah, but... Bed.

216
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,536
Come on, you get your stuff. I'll
drive you home. It's OK. I can walk.

217
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,720
All right.

218
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,416
Right, OK. Well,

219
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,416
I'll love you and leave you.

220
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,856
There's half a moussaka in there,

221
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,616
just wants warming up.

222
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,016
Thanks.

223
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,336
Can't walk home on her own!
It's dark. It's fine.

224
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,496
It's only round the corner.

225
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,976
And up the hill.

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,960
Drunks will be out.

227
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
You had a bad day?

228
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,496
No, it's been very quiet.

229
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,240
I've been able to catch up
on my paperwork.

230
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,936
Text me when you get in.

231
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,280
Right.

232
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,536
Night-night.

233
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,696
Ta-ta, love. Bye. Night-night.

234
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,080
Well, who's rattled your cage,
Grandmother?

235
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,400
Bed.

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
RYAN: Just getting some water.

237
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,200
You're smoking?

238
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,600
It's bad for you, smoking.

239
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
So I believe.

240
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,560
Why are you in a funny mood?

241
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,096
I'm not.

242
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,416
What will I do
if you do go off in that...

243
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,040
..thing to the Himalayas?

244
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,480
I don't know.

245
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,560
What would you like to do?

246
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,160
Come with you. SHE SCOFFS

247
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,840
You don't want to be hanging out
with me. You're 16.

248
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,456
I told him to shove his team
up his arse. But...

249
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,136
..that were only after
he started talking to me

250
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,776
like I was about six.

251
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,656
Yeah, well, like I say,
let's sort it out tomorrow

252
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,696
if you want
to get back on the team.

253
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,600
Do you want to get back
on the team?

254
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,280
Yeah.

255
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,616
Be better if he weren't
such a dickhead, though.

256
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,496
Well, dickheads
are a fact of life.

257
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,856
Anywhere you look,
there'll be a dickhead.

258
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,920
Better get used to it.

259
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,240
Night-night.

260
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,936
Night-night.

261
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,680
Love you.

262
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,200
The trick is to negotiate
your way around 'em...

263
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,656
..without 'em even realising
you think they are a dickhead.

264
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,256
Yeah.

265
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,600
And then revenge is a dish
best served cold.

266
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
PHARMACIST: I've got it all ready
for you.

267
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,560
Just popping out for a sec.

268
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,496
Faisal!

269
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,896
Hiya.

270
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,360
Have you got five minutes?

271
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,936
I thought he was going to
kill me. I think, one day,

272
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,440
he will kill me,
and no-one will even notice.

273
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,176
I've got to get out of there,
Faisal. Yeah. Well, yeah.

274
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,496
And the girls. I couldn't leave
without the girls. Course not.

275
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,576
It's happened before, this.

276
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,696
There's usually some lad
at school.

277
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,576
He... gets a fixation,
an obsession,

278
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,256
and he'll pick a fight
with them, basically,

279
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,496
to get their attention.

280
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,016
Pick a fight, knock their
confidence, then be the person

281
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,296
that picks them up
and turns their life around.

282
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,456
And then... God knows what.

283
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,176
They're usually kids
that haven't got

284
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,936
any proper parenting
going on at home.

285
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,296
But during this phase,
he gets all edgy

286
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,536
and then he gets handy
with his fists

287
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,000
and takes it out on me.

288
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,496
Thing is, when we first...

289
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,976
When you started helping me,

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,536
you did say you might be able
to help me get a little flat,

291
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,016
or something. So me and the girls,

292
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,136
we could get out of there.
Did I? Yeah!

293
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,656
Well, I might have suggested it

294
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,456
as an idea for you to
think about, but I don't...

295
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,616
It isn't something
I could pay for.

296
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,696
Is that... Is that what you...?

297
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,896
What I thought? Yeah,
that is what I thought.

298
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,416
I thought that you were
wanting to help me.

299
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,256
No, Joanna, I couldn't afford
to do that!

300
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,736
It must have just been
a suggestion. An idea.

301
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,056
Sorry if you thought... What, if I
thought that you cared about me?

302
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,416
I do! I did. I do. But I can't
afford to be buying a flat.

303
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,016
You said that you were
thinking about speculating

304
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,696
in property... Yeah, but not...
Not at the moment.

305
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,456
Definitely not at the moment.

306
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,616
Right.

307
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,456
These aren't my shops, you know?

308
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,856
I know you think they are.

309
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,176
I just manage this one
and the one down at Elland.

310
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,856
It's Anisha's dad that owns them

311
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,616
and me and her sister,
we just manage them.

312
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,720
And apart from that, money's
just a bit tight at the moment.

313
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,336
Police will be charging me
with something

314
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,456
when that diazepam
comes back from the lab,

315
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,576
and then they'll be leaning
on me again

316
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,256
to say where I got it from.

317
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,856
You know,
I'm not making threats,

318
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,216
but they might not be
happy with me just saying

319
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,080
I just found it behind
some toilets this time.

320
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,496
ANN: Hey, Shaf!
My interview was successful.

321
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,456
They want me to start my six-month
attachment at CID next week.

322
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,656
Yeah. Yeah. I saw you tiddling
about on your phone when

323
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,016
you're meant to be interfacing
with a member of the public.

324
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,656
So, guess what?

325
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,136
You won't be able
to boss me about

326
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,456
when you take over
from Catherine.

327
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,256
I will. I'll still be a rank
above you.

328
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,536
You won't, cos I'll be upstairs.

329
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,416
Yeah, but I will,
cos I'll come and find you

330
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,256
just to give you orders. CID!

331
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,696
Say, "Well done, Ann."
SARCASTICALLY: Well done!

332
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,096
Sitting in an office all day,
bending paperclips.

333
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,416
You're just jealous.

334
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,816
Yeah.

335
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,536
Not.

336
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,336
Oh, my God, Shaf. What?

337
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,576
Your ears! They've gone
green. Is it envy?

338
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,896
Not everybody wants to be
in CID, you know. Some of us

339
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,776
like being in uniform. Yeah.

340
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,536
And the rest. Hello, love.

341
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,216
I'm Acting Sergeant Shah.
This is PC Gallagher.

342
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,736
You may have heard, sadly,
somebody died yesterday

343
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,816
that lived in one
of these flats behind here.

344
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,696
And we're just having a chat
with everyone, just in case

345
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,296
you might have seen anything
or heard anything.

346
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,896
Is that all right if we pop in?

347
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Yeah, come in. Thank you.

348
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,160
Ta-ta.

349
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,696
RINGING TONE

350
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,776
I missed a call from you.
How are you doing?

351
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,776
Well, I'm on a house-to-house
down Elland, so...

352
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,136
Have there been
any developments?

353
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,400
No.

354
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,256
Have you said anything?

355
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,800
Nope.

356
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,760
Have you still got time
for a cup of tea today?

357
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,536
Yeah, I've got a meal break
at one.

358
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,320
I wanted to ask you about
this other thing.

359
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,376
What other thing?

360
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,296
I've been approached by this
journalist from the Guardian.

361
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,816
He's developing a piece
about organised crime links

362
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,536
to local government.
He saw a piece

363
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,256
I wrote in the Yorkshire Post
last year,

364
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,816
and he's asked me to do

365
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,600
some digging for him
on Darius Knezevic.

366
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,696
Oh, OK.

367
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,976
And I thought

368
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,976
half an hour with you might be a
good place to start.

369
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,096
Yeah, well, I can tell you
everything you need to know

370
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,496
about that sleazy twat.

371
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,696
Course, these days,
he behaves like butter

372
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,096
wouldn't melt up his arse.

373
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,736
And of course,
I can't tell you everything,

374
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,496
because if I did know
everything, he'd be in prison,

375
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,176
and for a not inconsiderable
period of time.

376
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,096
Do you know he's standing for
election onto Bradford City Council?

377
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,296
Oh. Well, West Yorkshire. But...

378
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,576
..that can't happen, surely.

379
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,536
What, are you serious?

380
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,456
You do know they elected
one of the biggest liars

381
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,416
and tax dodgers in history
to be the so-called leader

382
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,336
of the free world across
the pond not so long since?

383
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,016
Richard, I'm going to have to go.
Where do you want to meet up?

384
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,840
You decide. Text me.

385
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,080
Catherine...?

386
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,400
Alison?

387
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,456
Catherine.

388
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,096
Cawood.

389
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,416
I thought I'd seen your name on the
box as a newly released.

390
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,296
How are you?

391
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,360
I'm all right.

392
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,576
I'll give you a hand. Where are you
going with it? No, you're fine.

393
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,680
Don't be daft. Which one is it?

394
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,936
Thanks. It's just down here.

395
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,616
What are you lot doing here?
Is it about that woman?

396
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,096
Yeah, it's just a bit of
house-to-house.

397
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,456
You got five minutes?

398
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,816
Yeah.

399
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,816
I've got a settee to go with
this in the back of the van.

400
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,800
If you do want to be useful, then
there'll be summat to sit on.

401
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,816
Very enterprising.

402
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,336
Week out of prison
and you've got wheels?

403
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,336
I lost everything else.

404
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,936
The farm was only ever
on lease, so no chance.

405
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,416
One of the neighbours
let me leave this in his yard

406
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,976
and he's kept it ticking over.

407
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,240
Well, his dickhead son has.

408
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,240
And he's knackered the clutch.

409
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,096
Spent the last three years
at Aldborough. Open prison. Ah.

410
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,416
I learned how to do highlights.

411
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,176
CATHERINE CHUCKLES

412
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,256
And to drive a forklift truck.

413
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,816
Got me licence
to drive a forklift truck.

414
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,480
Don't ask me to do your hair.
You'll regret it.

415
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,056
Who's your probation officer?

416
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,376
Carol Sewell. Do you know her?

417
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,696
She drinks.

418
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,056
She turns up half-cut

419
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,376
or doped up to her eyeballs
on anti-anxiety meds.

420
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,216
She comes here,
tells me her problems,

421
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,696
and then she toddles off
somewhere else

422
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,936
before I can tell her any of mine.

423
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,856
Where are you working?

424
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,376
Ramsden's Ready Meals on the
industrial estate down here.

425
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,216
They supply all
t'big supermarkets.

426
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,696
It's money. If you hear of anything
else going, give us a shout.

427
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,376
I'll keep me ear to the ground.

428
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,536
Make a few phone calls, and...

429
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,256
Will you?

430
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,800
Yeah, sure.

431
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,376
So what's happening with
this lass in the flat upstairs?

432
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,160
She came out of a window. What, like
suicide? Drugs? Was she pushed?

433
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,576
Who knows?

434
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,136
You see, that pisses me off.

435
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,280
Look at this.

436
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,920
These windows
aren't meant to open so far.

437
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,880
Everything's bust.

438
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,336
And behold, no sprinkler system.

439
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,416
And even if there was a sprinkler
system,

440
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,576
chances are it wouldn't work.
Shall I tell you why?

441
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,296
Government contracts
are very lucrative,

442
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,456
so everyone wants them,
including -

443
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,256
surprise, surprise - criminals.

444
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,296
So...

445
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,616
So, you're saying these window
fittings where this girl died

446
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,176
were all from a dodgy source?

447
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,536
Well, I've no idea
where they're from.

448
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,176
What I'm saying is,
it's not impossible.

449
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,856
So...

450
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,176
..these companies spring up
and put on the hard sell,

451
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,976
and then when there's a
problem with the product,

452
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,176
which inevitably there is,
because it's shit,

453
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,696
where's the company gone?

454
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,816
Disappeared, winked up,
fucked off.

455
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,016
That'll be the Knezevics.
Moved on to the next scam.

456
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,816
So how do... If it is
the Knezevics, say,

457
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,136
how do they get the contract
in the first place?

458
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,456
Is there no due diligence?
Course,

459
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,056
but it's not impossible that
whoever's making the decisions

460
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,656
is bent or compromised,
or the criminal shows them

461
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,016
a quality product that works
and does the job,

462
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,096
but then when they supply them,

463
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,936
it looks for all the world
the same, but it isn't.

464
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,616
It's rubbish. But people only find
that out when it fails.

465
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,896
And this is on top of
all the drug-running

466
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,776
and people-trafficking and...
Yeah.

467
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,296
Yeah, yeah.
It just goes hand in hand.

468
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,696
CID took down this fella
in Huddersfield last year -

469
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,896
he was connected to something like
58 different businesses.

470
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,656
No! Yeah. How many CID hours

471
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,136
do you think that took to wade
through?

472
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,376
And of course, it's all about
laundering money in the end

473
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,576
and there's still any number
of ways to do that despite

474
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,136
the banks tightening things.
So, yeah.

475
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,456
Yeah, they still have their
car washes and their nail bars

476
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,616
and their newsagents
and their restaurants

477
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,296
and their lap-dancing bars, yeah.

478
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,016
Under the viaduct
in Sowerby Bridge.

479
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,416
Remember that?

480
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,096
They call themselves
businessmen.

481
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,656
They've got their finger in any
number of dirty little pies,

482
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,136
and it's naive to think that

483
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,376
they won't infiltrate
local government.

484
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,856
That's exactly what he's doing
in Bradford now.

485
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,376
It's all part of
how they operate.

486
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,976
It's how they keep themselves
informed.

487
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,720
It's how they hide
in plain sight.

488
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,296
Do you know...

489
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,056
..anything about a rumour

490
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,136
Darius Knezevic
is connected to this murder

491
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,800
that Tommy Lee Royce
is in court for next week?

492
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,120
I've heard things.

493
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,296
They'll never nail it onto
Darius Knezevic.

494
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,680
He's too clever.

495
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,976
You do know this could be
dangerous, don't you?

496
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,296
Yeah. For you.

497
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,960
If you get too close.

498
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,216
Right, I better be off.

499
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,696
It's just a chance to work on
something proper.

500
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,816
Something that can make
a difference.

501
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,576
Yeah, go for it. It needs doing.

502
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,096
Just be careful who you talk to

503
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,496
and how much you tell them
about yourself.

504
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,856
So what's the story about
this girl that died, then,

505
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
in this flat in Elland?

506
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,160
She came out of
a fourth-floor window.

507
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,176
Division went in and found
boxes and boxes and boxes

508
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,536
of cash, tens of thousands
of pounds. Drugs?

509
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,096
She'll have been cuckooed.
That'll be the Knezevics.

510
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,936
They can't launder money
fast enough,

511
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,056
so what do you do with it?
Where do you put it?

512
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,816
You hide it in somebody
else's place,

513
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,296
somebody who ain't got a clue

514
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,296
what's going on and couldn't
do a fat lot about it if they did.

515
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,496

00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,880
Fucking hell, now what?

517
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,440
Oh, shit. School.

518
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,256
Hello.

519
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,776
Is that Catherine? It is.

520
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,056
It's David Baines
over at Elm Wood.

521
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,176
Mr Baines, how's yourself?
I don't suppose

522
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,496
you might have time
to pop into the school?

523
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,896
What, now?
Yes, if that's possible.

524
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,376
Well, I can, as it happens,
I'll be passing that way.

525
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,016
But I'm on duty,
so I'll have to be brief.

526
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,360

I'll be in court next Tuesday.

529
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,896
Because you shopped me

530
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,560
to the police
all those months ago.

531
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,760
But I want you to know...

532
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,080
..I forgive you.

533
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,680
May the Lord be with you.

534
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,976
Chips or mash?

535
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,480
Er...

536
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,480
You going to hurry up, or what?

537
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,720

INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

541
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,696
MR BAINES: I'm not sure
that's necessarily the case.

542
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,136
I know his grandmother
often works shifts.

543
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,736
ROB: It'll be too much time
left to his own devices, then.

544
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,600
And there's no father, is
there? Not as far as I know.

545
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,336
Now what?

546
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,736
Oh, my God.

547
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,936
Did you have to come
dressed like that?

548
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,256
Shall I let him know
you're here, Mrs Cawood?

549
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,736
Yes, you can, love, thanks.
Is that a gun?

550
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,336
Thought police weren't supposed to
have guns in this country.

551
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,856
It's a Taser, you twit. They let you
loose with one of them?

552
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,400
Yeah. Why wouldn't they?
Aren't you a bit old? In.

553
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,680
Ta, love.

554
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,256
Ah, Catherine.
Thanks for popping in.

555
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,416
Mr Baines.

556
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,640
Mr Hepworth. How's your wife?

557
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,616
Yeah, she's... She's...

558
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,040
She's very, very, very...

559
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
She's all right, thank you.

560
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,856
Good.

561
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,496
So, what's the charge?

562
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,616
Would you like to sit down?

563
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,840
Ryan?

564
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,896
So, as I explained on the phone,

565
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,856
Mr Hepworth believes it was
Ryan who damaged his car.

566
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,496
Did you?

567
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,136
No. Do you know who did?

568
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,456
No. Has anyone talked to you
about someone touching

569
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,536
Mr Hepworth's car? No. SHE SIGHS

570
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,440
Show me your hands.

571
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,416
What's in your pockets? Nothing.

572
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,056
Have you asked him to empty his
pockets? I can't do that.

573
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,920
Stand up. Empty your pockets.

574
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,320
JANGLING

575
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,400
Really?

576
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,696
Do you know
when the damage occurred?

577
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,136
Well, between when I parked
the car there this morning

578
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,936
and when it was brought
to my attention

579
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,936
by another member
of staff at dinner time.

580
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,240
And who has access to that
area during the day?

581
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,216
Well, everyone.

582
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,456
But...

583
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,096
Any CCTV?

584
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,136
MR BAINES: Er, not covering
that area, no.

585
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,136
So, what's led you to believe
it was Ryan?

586
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,976
Only that he and I had
an altercation yesterday.

587
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,376
And I'm not accusing him.
I thought you were.

588
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,736
I'm sorry. I thought
that's why I was here.

589
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,496
Well, I thought...

590
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,120
I'm sorry, Mr Hepworth.
I thought you were.

591
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,080
Well, someone's done it.

592
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,856
Right. Well, if you want me to
write a police report, I can...

593
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,656
No, I don't think we need to
go down that route,

594
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,056
do we, Mr Hepworth?
Well, actually, I can't,

595
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,656
because if you are accusing Ryan,

596
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,336
another officer needs
to deal with it.

597
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,016
No, I just asked you in as his
grandmother, really, not as...

598
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,736
Although to be absolutely
honest with you,

599
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,816
you'll need more evidence

600
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,416
than the fact that you've had
an altercation with him.

601
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,616
And even then, we're not
really talking about

602
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,936
criminal damage, are we?
If the tyres had been slashed

603
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,216
and it was indelible marker pen,

604
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,016
then yeah, we would be.
But they weren't, so it isn't.

605
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,576
And can I ask you, Mr Hepworth,
are you quite certain

606
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,616
in your own mind that you
haven't made an assumption

607
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,496
it was Ryan precisely because you
did have this altercation

608
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,856
with him yesterday?
This was the altercation

609
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,936
about Ryan using
unacceptable language.

610
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,360
See, this is why it in't
adding up to me, because...

611
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,960
..last night, Ryan, well...

612
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,056
He was emotional, certainly.

613
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,736
But when he got over
being emotional,

614
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,536
he was talking about
apologising to Mr Hepworth

615
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,736
for saying something
he shouldn't have done

616
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,896
in the hope of getting back
on the team. Now, to my mind

617
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,976
that in't consistent with him
daubing up his car.

618
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,856
Back on the team?

619
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,616
The football team. That's what the
altercation was about.

620
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,456
No, it was about me being
blamed for something

621
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,696
which Cesco said,
which Cesco admitted,

622
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,736
and then he tried to chase us

623
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,456
on us bikes in his car.
No, I didn't.

624
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,720
Can't you arrest him for that?

625
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,776
Did you drive on the kerb?
No. Pleased to hear it.

626
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,136
Why don't we do
a bit more finding out?

627
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,576
See if we can find anyone
who saw something.

628
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,456
And then hopefully we can find a
solution that allows Ryan

629
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,576
to get his place back on the
team, if that's what he wants

630
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,896
and Mr Hepworth agrees.

631
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,376
Is that what you want, Ryan?

632
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,640
Yes, sir.

633
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,840
Well, I'm sorry, Catherine.
I hope I haven't wasted your time.

634
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,800
No. Like I say, I was passing.

635
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,456
You get your bike back? Yeah.

636
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,656
Well, that was weird. Hepworth is
weird. I kept telling you.

637
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,216
You know Mr Baines rang me like
you'd been caught red-handed,

638
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,136
and then not a scrap
of evidence.

639
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,216
I bet Hepworth did that
himself to his car

640
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,416
to get me into trouble.

641
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,976
Should have made him
turn his pockets out.

642
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,616
By the way, I didn't do it, FYI.

643
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,256
No, I know you didn't. How?

644
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,416
Because I've seen how you draw a
cock and balls when we play

645
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,480

Did you find time to look up
flats on the internet?

Yeah. Jo, I...
Seriously, I can't afford

669
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,216
anything like that at the moment.

670
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,096
I mean, you know,
if he's knocking you about,

671
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,016
you ought to go to the council
and ask for a flat. Yeah.

672
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,736
Yeah, I think you should do that.

673
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,256
They won't give me anything.

674
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,056
I'll go on a list.
People wait years.

675
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,416
Do you really think that's where I
want Florence and Poppy

676
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,736
to grow up? Is that where you'd want
your kids to grow up?

677
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,936
Do your parents know
what he's like?

678
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,240
They don't bother with me. Why?

679
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,640
I think I might kill him.

680
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,016
Well, yeah, certainly that would
solve some problems.

681
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,256
Might create a few new ones.

682
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,336
I should be allowed
to get divorced.

683
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,016
Except he'd win.
He'd win everything.

684
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,536
He'd get the girls, he'd get
the house, all of his pension.

685
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,536
Why would he win?
Because that's what he's like.

686
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,856
He always has to win.

687
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,256
But if he just wasn't there,

688
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,336
we could just live there.

689
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,776
Me and the girls. And my God,
my life would be so easy.

690
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,256
What would you live on?

691
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,896
Fresh air.

692
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,416
How would you pay the mortgage?

693
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,856
I don't know. I don't care.

694
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,840
I might get away with it.

695
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,496
People know what he's like.
That policewoman did.

696
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,776
She was nearly begging me to shop
him for coercive control.

697
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,720
Why didn't you? Because you said
you were going to help me.

698
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,416
And you know, as soon as
all that officialdom kicks in,

699
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,680
they can take your children off you
like batting an eyelid. So...

700
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,256
I don't know.

701
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,296
I don't know.
Maybe I should go talk to her.

702
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,736
I'm going to have to talk to

703
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,080
one of them anyway when
those drug results come back.

704
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,016
I'm being blackmailed.

705
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,016
That's why it's a struggle

706
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,296
to help you out
just at the moment.

707
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,456
These lads came into the shop.

708
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,496
One of them got me in my little
consulting room and he had a gun.

709
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,776
They want 1,800 quid a week, or...

710
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,896
Are you joking?

711
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,136
They're organised. They threatened
to hurt my family. Shit. Yeah.

712
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,816
Well, can't you go to the police?

713
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,336
How?

714
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,776
When I've been helping
people like you?

715
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,336
As soon as they start sniffing
around, they're going to

716
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,416
lift the lid on stuff I shouldn't
have been doing. So they've got me.

717
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm sorry. I wish I could
help you, but I can't.

718
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,440
Rob knows it was you
who gave me that diazepam.

719
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,936
How?

720
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,480
I told him.

721
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,536
Shit. Joanna!

722
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,936
I didn't want to.

723
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,576
But you know, when someone's wanting
to know stuff

724
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,496
and they're punching the crap
out of you until you tell them...

725
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,176
Why didn't you
make something up?

726
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,000
I did to start with, but...

727
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,400
I have thought about
how I'd do it.

728
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,080
If I did kill him.

729
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,976
He drinks.

730
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,936
Despite all his healthy body,
healthy minds stuff,

731
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,936
Friday night, he drinks
himself into a massive stupor.

732
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,296
And I've often thought

733
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,296
if I could just get hold of
some ketamine

734
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,496
and drop it into his drink,

735
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,736
then I could put a cushion
over his face.

736
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,976
Or an injection.

737
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,016
If you inject air into
someone's bloodstream.

738
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,536
Is that true?
That it'll kill them?

739
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,336
Yeah. I think if you got air
in your bloodstream,

740
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,600
you wouldn't be finding
a lot to laugh at.

741
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,496
Perhaps you can help me
with that, then.

742
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,016
If you can't help me with
a little flat.

743
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,496
I don't handle ketamine, Joanna.

744
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,696
It's not a prescription drug.

745
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,056
Well, something else, then.

746
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,920
You're a chemist.

747
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,856
This is very kind of you.

748
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,296
I'm decluttering. Anything you don't
want,

749
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,856
just drop back in the box
and I'll put it on Freecycle.

750
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,336
No, I think I can use all this.

751
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,696
Thanks.

752
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,576
Got you an interview for a job.

753
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,776
When?

754
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,096
It's driving a forklift truck.

755
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,496
No way!

756
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,576
Yeah, you've to ring that
number, give them your name

757
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,056
and then they'll book you in.
Nevison Gallagher? Yeah.

758
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,056
Industrial refrigeration.
It's on the same

759
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,080
industrial estate as
Ramsden's, down here. Oh, I know.

760
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,936
If there's ever anything
I can do for you,

761
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,560
you will let me know, won't you?

762
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,776
Yeah, well, actually - and this
isn't why I've done it

763
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
so do say no if it's not
convenient, but...

764
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,440
..if I leave you
my little Ford...

765
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,536
..could I borrow your truck for a
couple of hours on Saturday?

766
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,736
As long as you're not doing owt
dodgy in it.

767
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,040
I'm only out on licence.

768
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,280
MUSIC AND LAUGHTER

769
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,736
Dad! Avinash is having
driving lessons.

770
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,456
Can I get driving lessons?
How much are they?

771
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,936
An arm and a leg.
For my birthday?

772
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,936
Dad! Hmm? Oh. We'll have to see.
What do you mean?

773
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,640
I mean, we'll have to see.

774
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,696
FAISAL: Have you been
following my son

775
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,096
as well as my daughters?

776
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,776
I only ask because I'd love to
know what the little sod

777
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,080
gets up to when he's
supposed to be at school.

778
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,680
What's his name?

779
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,520
Tahir.

780
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,200
You haven't got a son, Faisal.

781
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,016
You try and fuck with me again

782
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,256
and I will prove to you

783
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,896
that I know your daughters
better than you do.

784
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,656
HE SUCKS TEETH

785
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,280
Especially that eldest one, eh?

786
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,016
Next week, yeah? Oh, and it'll be
Thursday, not Wednesday.

787
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,640
I'm getting married on Wednesday.

788
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,240
You not going to congratulate me?

789
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,416
Congratulations.

790
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,016
Nice.

791
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,456
And next week, cos you tried
to fuck with me, I want this

792
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,136
plus another 1,500. No, I can't do
that. Oh, you can.

793
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,096
You'd be silly not to. I told you,
the police might be onto me.

794
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,776
How?

795
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,496
Hmm? Eh?

796
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,576
How?

797
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,736
This... woman I gave
a few pills to got arrested,

798
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,976
and the pills were confiscated
by the police.

799
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,136
And she's not told them
where she got them from,

800
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,296
but I worry that she will.

801
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,856
She has to go back when the
tests on the drugs come back.

802
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,936
And I worry... that she's flaky

803
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,776
and that she could say anything,

804
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,960
and she reckons she's told her
husband, and he could, too.

805
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,216
Well, sort them out.

806
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,440
Both of them.

807
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,456
How?

808
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,216
That's not my problem.

809
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,600
And if it becomes my problem, well,
like I say...

810
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,736
..wouldn't take much to
persuade me to go say hello

811
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,120
to that eldest one of yours.

812
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,920
See you Thursday.

813
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,280
DOOR CLOSES

814
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,480
Where are you going? Football.

815
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,296
You back on t'team? Yeah.

816
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,456
He asked me yesterday.
Last minute. Only cos

817
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,256
he couldn't find anyone else
daft enough to do it.

818
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,576
Was he all right wi' you? Yeah.

819
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,040
Can I eat this pizza cold?

820
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,656
Yeah, why not?

821
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,376
Who are you playing?

822
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,280
I mean, I won't die from...

823
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,456
..cheese poisoning? I doubt it.
Who are you playing?

824
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,736
Hipperholme. There or here?

825
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,976
Here. Clare and Neil
are taking me,

826
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,360
cos I thought you were
working this Saturday.

827
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,400
Well, I was supposed to be,
but I'm not now, so...

828
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,776
Do you want me to come?

829
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,896
You don't have to. I texted
Clare about it last night

830
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,456
and she was fine with it.

831
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,816
So, we might drive into Leeds
and look at some shops, so...

832
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,280
..you can play with your Land Rover.
Love you! See ya. Bye.

833
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,720
PHONE RINGS

834
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,456
Hiya.

835
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,080
ALISON: How are you doing?

836
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,536
He's playing football. They
should be finishing any time,

837
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,040
then they're reckoning they're going
to Leeds shopping, so...

838
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,456
..I don't know.

839
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,576
I forgot to tell you, because
the clutch is knackered,

840
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,336
you need to double declutch
when you go up the gears.

841
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,016
OK.

842
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,936
Otherwise it pops into neutral.

843
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,136
OK.

844
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,336
And then you get honked at
by a twat behind.

845
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,840
OK.

846
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,216
Do you know how to
double declutch?

847
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,976
Oh, yeah. I was born in 1966.

848
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,536
I remember when cars
didn't always go. Memories!

849
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:13,280
They're on the move. I'm going to
have to go, Alison. Good luck. Ta.

850
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,720
GEARS CRUNCH

851
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,736
Oh, I stink. Has anyone
got any wet wipes?

852
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,576
There might be some in there.

853
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,296
What, in here? Mm-hm.

854
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,776
No, can't see any.

855
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,856
Oh, you're all right.
I forgot I had this.

856
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,576
DEODORANT SPRAYS

857
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,536
Jesus, Ryan! Oh, bloody 'ell, lad.
You must smell like

858
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,736
a poke of monkeys, needing to douse
yourself in chemicals like that.

859
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,360
Oh... DEODORANT SPRAYS

860
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,640
See you later, love.
See you in a bit.

861
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,160
PHONE RINGS

862
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,080
Shit.

863
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,296
Hiya.

864
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,160
Where are you?

865
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,696
Leeds.

866
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,736
Leeds?

867
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,616
I'm in a coffee shop. Are you?

868
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,016
They wanted to look round Game,

869
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,656
and they can spend hours
in there, them two,

870
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,616
and it bores me rigid, so I
come and get a cup of coffee

871
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,416
and let them fill their boots.

872
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,616
How was the football?

873
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,416
Well, they lost,
but they did very well.

874
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,816
Yeah?

875
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,576
3-0.

876
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,336
So, that's really not that bad
for them.

877
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,936
He did a couple of good dives
and he saved one or two,

878
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,240
you know, when he stopped talking
long enough to concentrate.

879
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
Anyway, what can I do you for?

880
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,720
Nothing, really. I was just...

881
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,520
..ringing to find out
how you'd gone on.

882
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,496
Oh, you mean with that Hepworth?

883
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,056
Er...

884
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,616
..he were fine.

885
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,896
There were no incidents,
no nasty comments.

886
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,856
Not that I know of. I didn't see
much of him, to be honest.

887
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,080
What did you say to him?

888
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,480
Nothing much.

889
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,376
I think Ryan's little old granny

890
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,736
turning up dressed like
RoboCop didn't compute,

891
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,320
so his undercarriage fell off.

892
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,080
You at a loose end?

893
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,200
No.

894
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,440
I hate Leeds.

895
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,496
Do you?

896
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,400
Don't know why we come.
I'd rather be at home.

897
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,240
Mm.

898
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,536
Is there owt else?

899
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,616
Only I've got a moderately
interesting looking sandwich

900
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,216
staring at me and it won't

901
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,080
get out of its bit of packaging all
by itself.

902
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,496
No.

903
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,280
No, I was just...

904
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,040
Yeah, wondering
how you'd gone on.

905
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,616
So, I'll see you when I see you.

906
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,720
Yep.

907
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,200
When you get back from Leeds.

908
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,160
OK. Ta-ta.

909
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,240
Bye-bye.

910
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,400
