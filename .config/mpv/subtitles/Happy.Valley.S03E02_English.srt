1
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,479
It's Clare.

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,519
It's your Clare.

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,079
And Neil Ackroyd.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,680
Is that her partner?
Neil Ackroyd?

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,999
Looks like they started
visiting him just over a year ago.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,959
There's been four visits,

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,359
and another one arranged for
this Saturday.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,639
This coming Saturday, 2pm.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,039
You all right?

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,520
Catherine?

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,680
Speak to me.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,519
Catherine.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,800
Why?

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,760
Why would they do that?

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,000
Why would Clare...?

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,640
What will you do?

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,280
Saturdays.

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,199
All Saturdays when they've been
taking him to his football,

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,520
and I've been working.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,080
You think you know people.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,999
How... how?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,120
How...?

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,839
How's he got in touch with
our Ryan in the first place?

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,359
Does Royce know your address?
Yeah.

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,079
When he got that Frances Wealand
Drummond,

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,279
whatever her name was,
to bring that Scalextric.

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,719
But I'd have... No, I'd have
seen something, a letter,

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,199
if it'd come to our house.
Ryan never gets any post

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,039
and when he does,
he never bothers to open it.

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,920
Well, does Royce know their
address? Clare and Neil's?

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,400
How?

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
And how could Ryan
have got in touch with him?

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,119
How could he have known
he'd moved prisons?

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,079
I didn't know
he'd moved prisons.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,720
I don't know.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,559
Four times.
All within this last year.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,279
Nothing before that.

38
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,639
I've never liked that Neil.
He's spineless.

39
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,719
And Clare, for God's sake.

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,360
You see, she's the same.
Is she? Weak.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,799
What am I going to do?

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,240
Well, you're not overreacting,
which is good.

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,359
Shit.

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,999
Can I do anything?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,399
No.

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
Do you want to go home?
No.

47
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,040
I might ask for this Saturday
off, though.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,439
What are you doing?

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,239
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,719
That's your...
Is that your lock?

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,200
No, this is my lock.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,879
Some dickhead's
chained us bikes together. What?

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,839
Ah, boys, there you are.

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,999
You not racing off today?

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,119
Somebody's chained
us bikes together... sir.

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,640
Oh, what a shame.

57
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,999
So, while you're here,
you're both in detention.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,039
What for? Did you do this? You know
perfectly well what for. A week.

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,839
Lunchtime detention.
What have I done?

60
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,479
I'm not arguing about it.

61
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,879
It was him. I never said owt.
I was just with him.

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,239
And yet... Oh, yeah!

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,359
You ran off.

64
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,039
Because you were chasing us
in your car.

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,039
Look, I have warned you before

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,959
about what thin ice you are
skating on, motormouth.

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,439
So if I were you, I'd shut it.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,999
Take your punishment like a man.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,559
I know it's a bit of a leap,

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,799
but use this in future to think
about what comes out of this.

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,959
Piss off, you twat!
What did you say?

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,839
Talking to us
like six-year-olds.

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,599
Maybe it's because you behave like
you're six year old!

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,159
Yeah, up your arse. Right, that's
it! You're off the football team!

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,559
You can't do that, sir!

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,639
Good. I don't care. I've resigned
off it anyway cos it's shit!

77
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,719
I'm not having that!
You come back here now!

78
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,559
It was me, sir. Yesterday.

79
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,199
I said it. Punish me!

80
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,479
It's not even worth being on! It's
the shittest team I've ever seen!

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,399
You just can't stop yourself,
can you?

82
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,879
They play like a load of little
girls! It's an embarrassment!

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,519
You can't kick him
off the football team, sir.

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,039
It's the only thing
he's any good at!

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,879
Do you not want your bike
back, then, Cawood?

86
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,960
Swivel!

87
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,239
What have I done to him?!
SMASHING AND CRASHING

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,959
Right. It sounds like his
bookshelf's just gone over,

89
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,999
so... that'll be that little
telly you gave him smashed.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,279
I'd come round and help, but
there's only me and Lexie on

91
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,519
till Marie turns up.

92
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,959
No, you're all right.
I just wanted to share the joy.

93
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,639
I don't know exactly
what's gone on,

94
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,839
but I think that games
teacher's a funny beggar.

95
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,119
May well be.

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,279
But if it is escalating
and our Ryan's

97
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,919
saying stuff he shouldn't,

98
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,399
then he is going to get into bother.

99
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,799
CLATTERING UPSTAIRS
SHE SIGHS, RYAN YELLS

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,519
He's trying to get t'door
off its hinges now.

101
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,079
You want to put him on?
I'll try and have

102
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,479
a quick word with him. No, he's...
He won't come to t'phone.

103
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,680
He hasn't threatened
to hurt you, has he? No!

104
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,719
He's called me
a drug-addled piss artist,

105
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,719
but I'm trying not
to take it personally.

106
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,039
I'm trying to remind myself

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,799
that it's the anger speaking
and not

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,879
him just being
a repulsive little shit.

109
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,119
Love, I'm going to have to go.

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,959
As soon as Marie gets here,
I'll phone you,

111
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,999
and if you want me to pop round,

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,799
I will. OK.

113
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,519
What have I done?!
HE SCREAMS

114
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,560
Bye.

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,360
MUSIC PLAYS,
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,600
ANISHA LAUGHS

117
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,319
Mm-hm. Can we bring anything?

118
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,039
Can we bring the dessert?

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,639
Oh, hang on.

120
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,879
Are we all right to go
to Zainab and Farhan's

121
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,439
on Friday evening? They got
the decking finished.

122
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,839
15 grand.

123
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,759
Yeah, we'll be there.
Hi, Dad. Hiya. You all right?

124
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,199
Just figuring out how I'm going to
pay for the new decking

125
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,159
your mother will be requiring
shortly. How come?

126
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,999
Probably just as soon as
she comes off the phone.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,839
Even though there's nothing
wrong with the deck...

128
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,479
Her sister's got some.
Auntie Zainab? Cool!

129
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,639
There is water in the tap,
you know.

130
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,639
What? Nothing. Yeah, but it doesn't
taste t'same.

131
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,519
It does! It's water.
It tastes exactly the...

132
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,880
same...

133
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,720
Great! Mm-hm.

134
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Clare and Neil? No way.

135
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
What are you going to do?

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,919
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

137
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,119
Could it be...

138
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,159
Well, not them?

139
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,359
Somebody using their names
for some reason?

140
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,399
I don't know. Yeah, well,
I wondered that, but no.

141
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,559
Every visit's coincided with
when I've been working Saturdays,

142
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,679
so, no, it'd be too much
of a coincidence. It's them.

143
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,439
You know, and this is
the bloke that's up in court

144
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,359
next week for another murder,
and Clare knows that.

145
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,559
We've even talked about it.

146
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,999
Ask her.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,399
No. No, I'm not going to ask
any of them anything.

148
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,679
I'm going to watch them.
I'm going to observe.

149
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,039
And come Saturday,
I'm going to follow 'em,

150
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,599
and... I don't know.
I don't know.

151
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,119
I don't know.

152
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,919
You can't avoid 'em.

153
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,439
Well, I can't avoid 'em,
you're right.

154
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,919
She's in there. She rang me,
and that's another saga.

155
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,639
He's had a spat with
his bloody games teacher

156
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,800
and got himself chucked off
his football team.

157
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,599
Is that that Gary Gackowski murder

158
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,719
Royce is in court for next week?

159
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,239
Yeah. Why?
What do you know about it?

160
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,560
Oh, it's just... something
I'm working on.

161
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,079
You're around tomorrow?

162
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,639
Well, I'm working, but I can be.

163
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,039
Why?

164
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,639
Want to meet up?

165
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,599
For a cup of tea or something.

166
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,759
Catch up...

167
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,879
properly.

168
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,960
Yeah, can do.

169
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,680
TV IN BACKGROUND

170
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,959
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

171
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
Come on. Bed.

172
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,160
Hiya.

173
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,799
Why aren't you in bed?

174
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,879
It's five to 11.
He's got school tomorrow.

175
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,319
I've been kicked off
t'football team

176
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,599
for something I didn't even do.

177
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,559
So I understand, and then you
trashed your bedroom. He did, yeah.

178
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,399
But we've tidied most of it up now,
so... Oh, have you? Oh, good.

179
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,439
Well, that'll teach him.
That's a good message.

180
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,239
Trash your bedroom
and your Auntie Clare'll

181
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,039
tidy it up for you. I helped him

182
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,199
because he calmed down
and then he apologised.

183
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,119
So, what's happened, then?

184
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,119
Hepworth. He's a twat.
Oh, swearing!

185
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,719
So if I ring Mr Baines
in the morning

186
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,319
and if I ask for an
appointment with him,

187
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,359
we explain what's happened,
that you've had a spat

188
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,680
with Mr Hepworth, that's going to be
your defence, is it?

189
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,839
He's a twat?

190
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,719
He's chased us in his car,
on us bikes.

191
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,639
And then he's chucked me
off t'team. For nothing? Yeah.

192
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,799
Cesco shouted, "Have you
had your oats, sir?"

193
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,119
which is what started it, but...

194
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,559
Yeah. And nothing else was said?

195
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,399
Yeah... Well, yeah,

196
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,879
quite a lot else was said,
but I didn't start it.

197
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
I DEFINITELY didn't start it.

198
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,040
I can't think about this now.
Go to bed. Yeah, but... Bed.

199
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,559
Come on, you get your stuff. I'll
drive you home. It's OK. I can walk.

200
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
All right.

201
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,439
Right, OK. Well,

202
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,439
I'll love you and leave you.

203
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,879
There's half a moussaka in there,

204
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,639
just wants warming up.

205
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,039
Thanks.

206
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,359
Can't walk home on her own!
It's dark. It's fine.

207
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,519
It's only round the corner.

208
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,999
And up the hill.

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,960
Drunks will be out.

210
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,200
You had a bad day?

211
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,519
No, it's been very quiet.

212
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,240
I've been able to catch up
on my paperwork.

213
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,959
Text me when you get in.

214
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,280
Right.

215
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,559
Night-night.

216
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,719
Ta-ta, love. Bye. Night-night.

217
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,080
Well, who's rattled your cage,
Grandmother?

218
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,400
Bed.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,680
Just getting some water.

220
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,200
You're smoking?

221
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,600
It's bad for you, smoking.

222
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,160
So I believe.

223
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,560
Why are you in a funny mood?

224
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,119
I'm not.

225
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,439
What will I do
if you do go off in that...

226
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,040
thing to the Himalayas?

227
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
I don't know.

228
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,560
What would you like to do?

229
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,160
Come with you.
SHE SCOFFS

230
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
You don't want to be hanging out
with me. You're 16.

231
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,479
I told him to shove his team
up his arse. But...

232
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,159
that were only after
he started talking to me

233
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,799
like I was about six.

234
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,679
Yeah, well, like I say,
let's sort it out tomorrow

235
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,719
if you want
to get back on the team.

236
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
Do you want to get back
on the team?

237
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,280
Yeah.

238
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,639
Be better if he weren't
such a dickhead, though.

239
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,519
Well, dickheads
are a fact of life.

240
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,879
Anywhere you look,
there'll be a dickhead.

241
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,920
Better get used to it.

242
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,240
Night-night.

243
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,959
Night-night.

244
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,680
Love you.

245
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,200
The trick is to negotiate
your way around 'em...

246
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,679
without 'em even realising
you think they are a dickhead.

247
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,279
Yeah.

248
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,600
And then revenge is a dish
best served cold.

249
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,000
I've got it all ready for you.

250
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,560
Just popping out for a sec.

251
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,519
Faisal!

252
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,919
Hiya.

253
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,360
Have you got five minutes?

254
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,959
I thought he was going to
kill me. I think, one day,

255
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,440
he will kill me,
and no-one will even notice.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,199
I've got to get out of there,
Faisal. Yeah. Well, yeah.

257
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,519
And the girls. I couldn't leave
without the girls. Course not.

258
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,599
It's happened before, this.

259
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,719
There's usually some lad
at school.

260
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,599
He... gets a fixation,
an obsession,

261
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,279
and he'll pick a fight
with them, basically,

262
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,519
to get their attention.

263
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,039
Pick a fight, knock their
confidence, then be the person

264
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,319
that picks them up
and turns their life around.

265
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,479
And then... God knows what.

266
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,199
They're usually kids
that haven't got

267
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,959
any proper parenting
going on at home.

268
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,319
But during this phase,
he gets all edgy

269
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,559
and then he gets handy
with his fists

270
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
and takes it out on me.

271
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,519
Thing is, when we first...

272
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,999
When you started helping me,

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,559
you did say you might be able
to help me get a little flat,

274
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,039
or something. So me and the girls,

275
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,159
we could get out of there.
Did I? Yeah!

276
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,679
Well, I might have suggested it

277
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,479
as an idea for you to
think about, but I don't...

278
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,639
It isn't something
I could pay for.

279
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,719
Is that... Is that what you...?

280
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,919
What I thought? Yeah,
that is what I thought.

281
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,439
I thought that you were
wanting to help me.

282
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,279
No, Joanna, I couldn't afford
to do that!

283
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,759
It must have just been
a suggestion. An idea.

284
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,079
Sorry if you thought... What, if I
thought that you cared about me?

285
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,439
I do! I did. I do. But I can't
afford to be buying a flat.

286
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,039
You said that you were
thinking about speculating

287
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,719
in property... Yeah, but not...
Not at the moment.

288
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,479
Definitely not at the moment.

289
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,639
Right.

290
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,479
These aren't my shops, you know?

291
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,879
I know you think they are.

292
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,199
I just manage this one
and the one down at Elland.

293
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,879
It's Anisha's dad that owns them

294
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,639
and me and her sister,
we just manage them.

295
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,720
And apart from that, money's
just a bit tight at the moment.

296
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,359
Police will be charging me
with something

297
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,479
when that diazepam
comes back from the lab,

298
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,599
and then they'll be leaning
on me again

299
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,279
to say where I got it from.

300
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,879
You know,
I'm not making threats,

301
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,239
but they might not be
happy with me just saying

302
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,080
I just found it behind
some toilets this time.

303
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,519
Hey, Shaf!
My interview was successful.

304
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,479
They want me to start my six-month
attachment at CID next week.

305
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,679
Yeah. Yeah. I saw you tiddling
about on your phone when

306
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,039
you're meant to be interfacing
with a member of the public.

307
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,679
So, guess what?

308
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,159
You won't be able
to boss me about

309
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,479
when you take over
from Catherine.

310
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,279
I will. I'll still be a rank
above you.

311
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,559
You won't, cos I'll be upstairs.

312
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,439
Yeah, but I will,
cos I'll come and find you

313
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,279
just to give you orders. CID!

314
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,719
- Say, "Well done, Ann."
- Well done!

315
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,119
Sitting in an office all day,
bending paperclips.

316
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,439
You're just jealous.

317
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,839
Yeah.

318
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,559
Not.

319
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,359
Oh, my God, Shaf. What?

320
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,599
Your ears! They've gone
green. Is it envy?

321
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,919
Not everybody wants to be
in CID, you know. Some of us

322
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,799
like being in uniform. Yeah.

323
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,559
And the rest.
Hello, love.

324
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,239
I'm Acting Sergeant Shah.
This is PC Gallagher.

325
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,759
You may have heard, sadly,
somebody died yesterday

326
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,839
that lived in one
of these flats behind here.

327
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,719
And we're just having a chat
with everyone, just in case

328
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,319
you might have seen anything
or heard anything.

329
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,919
Is that all right if we pop in?

330
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Yeah, come in. Thank you.

331
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,160
Ta-ta.

332
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,719
RINGING TONE

333
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,799
I missed a call from you.
How are you doing?

334
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,799
Well, I'm on a house-to-house
down Elland, so...

335
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,159
Have there been
any developments?

336
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,400
No.

337
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,279
Have you said anything?

338
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,800
Nope.

339
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,760
Have you still got time
for a cup of tea today?

340
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,559
Yeah, I've got a meal break
at one.

341
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,320
I wanted to ask you about
this other thing.

342
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,399
What other thing?

343
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,319
I've been approached by this
journalist from the Guardian.

344
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,839
He's developing a piece
about organised crime links

345
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,559
to local government.
He saw a piece

346
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,279
I wrote in the Yorkshire Post
last year,

347
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,839
and he's asked me to do

348
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,600
some digging for him
on Darius Knezevic.

349
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,719
Oh, OK.

350
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,999
And I thought

351
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,999
half an hour with you might be a
good place to start.

352
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,119
Yeah, well, I can tell you
everything you need to know

353
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,519
about that sleazy twat.

354
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,719
Course, these days,
he behaves like butter

355
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,119
wouldn't melt up his arse.

356
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,759
And of course,
I can't tell you everything,

357
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,519
because if I did know
everything, he'd be in prison,

358
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,199
and for a not inconsiderable
period of time.

359
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,119
Do you know he's standing for
election onto Bradford City Council?

360
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,319
Oh. Well, West Yorkshire.
But...

361
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,599
that can't happen, surely.

362
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,559
What, are you serious?

363
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,479
You do know they elected
one of the biggest liars

364
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,439
and tax dodgers in history
to be the so-called leader

365
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,359
of the free world across
the pond not so long since?

366
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,039
Richard, I'm going to have to go.
Where do you want to meet up?

367
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,840
You decide. Text me.

368
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,080
Catherine...?

369
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,400
Alison?

370
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,479
Catherine.

371
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,119
Cawood.

372
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,439
I thought I'd seen your name on the
box as a newly released.

373
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,319
How are you?

374
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm all right.

375
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,599
I'll give you a hand. Where are you
going with it? No, you're fine.

376
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,680
Don't be daft. Which one is it?

377
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,959
Thanks. It's just down here.

378
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,639
What are you lot doing here?
Is it about that woman?

379
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,119
Yeah, it's just a bit of
house-to-house.

380
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,479
You got five minutes?

381
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,839
Yeah.

382
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,839
I've got a settee to go with
this in the back of the van.

383
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,800
If you do want to be useful, then
there'll be summat to sit on.

384
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,839
Very enterprising.

385
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,359
Week out of prison
and you've got wheels?

386
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,359
I lost everything else.

387
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,959
The farm was only ever
on lease, so no chance.

388
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,439
One of the neighbours
let me leave this in his yard

389
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,999
and he's kept it ticking over.

390
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,240
Well, his dickhead son has.

391
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,240
And he's knackered the clutch.

392
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,119
Spent the last three years
at Aldborough. Open prison. Ah.

393
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,439
I learned how to do highlights.

394
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,199
CATHERINE CHUCKLES

395
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,279
And to drive a forklift truck.

396
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,839
Got me licence
to drive a forklift truck.

397
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,480
Don't ask me to do your hair.
You'll regret it.

398
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,079
Who's your probation officer?

399
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,399
Carol Sewell. Do you know her?

400
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,719
She drinks.

401
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,079
She turns up half-cut

402
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,399
or doped up to her eyeballs
on anti-anxiety meds.

403
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,239
She comes here,
tells me her problems,

404
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,719
and then she toddles off
somewhere else

405
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,959
before I can tell her any of mine.

406
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,879
Where are you working?

407
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,399
Ramsden's Ready Meals on the
industrial estate down here.

408
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,239
They supply all
t'big supermarkets.

409
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,719
It's money. If you hear of anything
else going, give us a shout.

410
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,399
I'll keep me ear to the ground.

411
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,559
Make a few phone calls, and...

412
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,279
Will you?

413
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,800
Yeah, sure.

414
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,399
So what's happening with
this lass in the flat upstairs?

415
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,160
She came out of a window. What, like
suicide? Drugs? Was she pushed?

416
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,599
Who knows?

417
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,159
You see, that pisses me off.

418
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,280
Look at this.

419
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,920
These windows
aren't meant to open so far.

420
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,880
Everything's bust.

421
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,359
And behold, no sprinkler system.

422
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,439
And even if there was a sprinkler
system,

423
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,599
chances are it wouldn't work.
Shall I tell you why?

424
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,319
Government contracts
are very lucrative,

425
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,479
so everyone wants them,
including -

426
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,279
surprise, surprise - criminals.

427
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,319
So...

428
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,639
So, you're saying these window
fittings where this girl died

429
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,199
were all from a dodgy source?

430
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,559
Well, I've no idea
where they're from.

431
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,199
What I'm saying is,
it's not impossible.

432
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,879
So...

433
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,199
these companies spring up
and put on the hard sell,

434
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,999
and then when there's a
problem with the product,

435
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,199
which inevitably there is,
because it's shit,

436
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,719
where's the company gone?

437
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,839
Disappeared, winked up,
fucked off.

438
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,039
That'll be the Knezevics.
Moved on to the next scam.

439
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,839
So how do... If it is
the Knezevics, say,

440
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,159
how do they get the contract
in the first place?

441
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,479
Is there no due diligence?
Course,

442
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,079
but it's not impossible that
whoever's making the decisions

443
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,679
is bent or compromised,
or the criminal shows them

444
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,039
a quality product that works
and does the job,

445
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,119
but then when they supply them,

446
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,959
it looks for all the world
the same, but it isn't.

447
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,639
It's rubbish. But people only find
that out when it fails.

448
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,919
And this is on top of
all the drug-running

449
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,799
and people-trafficking and...
Yeah.

450
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,319
Yeah, yeah.
It just goes hand in hand.

451
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,719
CID took down this fella
in Huddersfield last year -

452
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,919
he was connected to something like
58 different businesses.

453
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,679
No! Yeah. How many CID hours

454
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,159
do you think that took to wade
through?

455
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,399
And of course, it's all about
laundering money in the end

456
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,599
and there's still any number
of ways to do that despite

457
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,159
the banks tightening things.
So, yeah.

458
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,479
Yeah, they still have their
car washes and their nail bars

459
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,639
and their newsagents
and their restaurants

460
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,319
and their lap-dancing bars, yeah.

461
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,039
Under the viaduct
in Sowerby Bridge.

462
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,439
Remember that?

463
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,119
They call themselves
businessmen.

464
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,679
They've got their finger in any
number of dirty little pies,

465
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,159
and it's naive to think that

466
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,399
they won't infiltrate
local government.

467
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,879
That's exactly what he's doing
in Bradford now.

468
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,399
It's all part of
how they operate.

469
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,999
It's how they keep themselves
informed.

470
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,720
It's how they hide
in plain sight.

471
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,319
Do you know...

472
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,079
anything about a rumour

473
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,159
Darius Knezevic
is connected to this murder

474
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,800
that Tommy Lee Royce
is in court for next week?

475
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,120
I've heard things.

476
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,319
They'll never nail it onto
Darius Knezevic.

477
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,680
He's too clever.

478
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,999
You do know this could be
dangerous, don't you?

479
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,319
Yeah. For you.

480
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,960
If you get too close.

481
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,239
Right, I better be off.

482
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,719
It's just a chance to work on
something proper.

483
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,839
Something that can make
a difference.

484
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,599
Yeah, go for it.
It needs doing.

485
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,119
Just be careful who you talk to

486
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,519
and how much you tell them
about yourself.

487
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,879
So what's the story about
this girl that died, then,

488
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,640
in this flat in Elland?

489
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,160
She came out of
a fourth-floor window.

490
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,199
Division went in and found
boxes and boxes and boxes

491
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,559
of cash, tens of thousands
of pounds. Drugs?

492
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,119
She'll have been cuckooed.
That'll be the Knezevics.

493
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,959
They can't launder money
fast enough,

494
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,079
so what do you do with it?
Where do you put it?

495
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,839
You hide it in somebody
else's place,

496
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,319
somebody who ain't got a clue

497
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,319
what's going on and couldn't
do a fat lot about it if they did.

498
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,519
PHONE RINGS

499
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
Fucking hell, now what?

500
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,440
Oh, shit. School.

501
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,279
Hello.

502
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,799
Is that Catherine? It is.

503
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,079
It's David Baines
over at Elm Wood.

504
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,199
Mr Baines, how's yourself?
I don't suppose

505
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,519
you might have time
to pop into the school?

506
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,919
What, now?
Yes, if that's possible.

507
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,399
Well, I can, as it happens,
I'll be passing that way.

508
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,039
But I'm on duty,
so I'll have to be brief.

509
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,360
What's occurred?

510
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,240
DOOR OPENS

511
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,480
I'll be in court next Tuesday.

512
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,919
Because you shopped me

513
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,560
to the police
all those months ago.

514
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,760
But I want you to know...

515
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,080
I forgive you.

516
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,680
May the Lord be with you.

517
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,999
Chips or mash?

518
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,480
Er...

519
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,480
You going to hurry up, or what?

520
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,720
Fucking doing?

521
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,680
SHOUTING

522
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,680
Enough! Enough.

523
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,040
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

524
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,719
I'm not sure
that's necessarily the case.

525
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,159
I know his grandmother
often works shifts.

526
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,759
It'll be too much time
left to his own devices, then.

527
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,600
And there's no father, is
there? Not as far as I know.

528
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,359
Now what?

529
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,759
Oh, my God.

530
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,959
Did you have to come
dressed like that?

531
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,279
Shall I let him know
you're here, Mrs Cawood?

532
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,759
Yes, you can, love, thanks.
Is that a gun?

533
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,359
Thought police weren't supposed to
have guns in this country.

534
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,879
It's a Taser, you twit. They let you
loose with one of them?

535
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,400
Yeah. Why wouldn't they?
Aren't you a bit old? In.

536
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,680
Ta, love.

537
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,279
Ah, Catherine.
Thanks for popping in.

538
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,439
Mr Baines.

539
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,640
Mr Hepworth.
How's your wife?

540
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,639
Yeah, she's... She's...

541
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,040
She's very, very, very...

542
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,120
She's all right, thank you.

543
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,879
Good.

544
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,519
So, what's the charge?

545
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,639
Would you like to sit down?

546
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,840
Ryan?

547
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,919
So, as I explained on the phone,

548
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,879
Mr Hepworth believes it was
Ryan who damaged his car.

549
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,519
Did you?

550
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,159
No. Do you know who did?

551
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,479
No. Has anyone talked to you
about someone touching

552
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,559
Mr Hepworth's car? No.
SHE SIGHS

553
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,440
Show me your hands.

554
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,439
What's in your pockets?
Nothing.

555
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,079
Have you asked him to empty his
pockets? I can't do that.

556
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,920
Stand up. Empty your pockets.

557
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,320
JANGLING

558
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,400
Really?

559
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,719
Do you know
when the damage occurred?

560
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,159
Well, between when I parked
the car there this morning

561
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,959
and when it was brought
to my attention

562
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,959
by another member
of staff at dinner time.

563
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,240
And who has access to that
area during the day?

564
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,239
Well, everyone.

565
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,479
But...

566
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,119
Any CCTV?

567
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,159
Er, not covering that area, no.

568
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,159
So, what's led you to believe
it was Ryan?

569
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,999
Only that he and I had
an altercation yesterday.

570
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,399
And I'm not accusing him.
I thought you were.

571
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,759
I'm sorry. I thought
that's why I was here.

572
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,519
Well, I thought...

573
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,120
I'm sorry, Mr Hepworth.
I thought you were.

574
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,080
Well, someone's done it.

575
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,879
Right. Well, if you want me to
write a police report, I can...

576
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,679
No, I don't think we need to
go down that route,

577
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,079
do we, Mr Hepworth?
Well, actually, I can't,

578
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,679
because if you are accusing Ryan,

579
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,359
another officer needs
to deal with it.

580
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,039
No, I just asked you in as his
grandmother, really, not as...

581
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,759
Although to be absolutely
honest with you,

582
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,839
you'll need more evidence

583
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,439
than the fact that you've had
an altercation with him.

584
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,639
And even then, we're not
really talking about

585
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,959
criminal damage, are we?
If the tyres had been slashed

586
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,239
and it was indelible marker pen,

587
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,039
then yeah, we would be.
But they weren't, so it isn't.

588
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,599
And can I ask you, Mr Hepworth,
are you quite certain

589
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,639
in your own mind that you
haven't made an assumption

590
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,519
it was Ryan precisely because you
did have this altercation

591
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,879
with him yesterday?
This was the altercation

592
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,959
about Ryan using
unacceptable language.

593
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,360
See, this is why it in't
adding up to me, because...

594
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,960
last night, Ryan, well...

595
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,079
He was emotional, certainly.

596
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,759
But when he got over
being emotional,

597
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,559
he was talking about
apologising to Mr Hepworth

598
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,759
for saying something
he shouldn't have done

599
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,919
in the hope of getting back
on the team. Now, to my mind

600
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,999
that in't consistent with him
daubing up his car.

601
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,879
Back on the team?

602
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,639
The football team. That's what the
altercation was about.

603
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,479
No, it was about me being
blamed for something

604
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,719
which Cesco said,
which Cesco admitted,

605
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,759
and then he tried to chase us

606
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,479
on us bikes in his car.
No, I didn't.

607
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,720
Can't you arrest him for that?

608
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,799
Did you drive on the kerb?
No. Pleased to hear it.

609
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,159
Why don't we do
a bit more finding out?

610
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,599
See if we can find anyone
who saw something.

611
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,479
And then hopefully we can find a
solution that allows Ryan

612
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,599
to get his place back on the
team, if that's what he wants

613
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,919
and Mr Hepworth agrees.

614
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,399
Is that what you want, Ryan?

615
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,640
Yes, sir.

616
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,840
Well, I'm sorry, Catherine.
I hope I haven't wasted your time.

617
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,800
No. Like I say, I was passing.

618
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,479
You get your bike back?
Yeah.

619
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,679
Well, that was weird. Hepworth is
weird. I kept telling you.

620
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,239
You know Mr Baines rang me like
you'd been caught red-handed,

621
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,159
and then not a scrap
of evidence.

622
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,239
I bet Hepworth did that
himself to his car

623
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,439
to get me into trouble.

624
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,999
Should have made him
turn his pockets out.

625
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,639
By the way, I didn't do it, FYI.

626
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,279
No, I know you didn't.
How?

627
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,439
Because I've seen how you draw a
cock and balls when we play

628
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,480

said you'd be here.

650
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,840
Did you find time to look up
flats on the internet?

651
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,519
Yeah. Jo, I...
Seriously, I can't afford

652
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,239
anything like that at the moment.

653
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,119
I mean, you know,
if he's knocking you about,

654
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,039
you ought to go to the council
and ask for a flat. Yeah.

655
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,759
Yeah, I think you should do that.

656
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,279
They won't give me anything.

657
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,079
I'll go on a list.
People wait years.

658
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,439
Do you really think that's where I
want Florence and Poppy

659
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,759
to grow up? Is that where you'd want
your kids to grow up?

660
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,959
Do your parents know
what he's like?

661
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,240
They don't bother with me.
Why?

662
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,640
I think I might kill him.

663
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,039
Well, yeah, certainly that would
solve some problems.

664
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,279
Might create a few new ones.

665
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,359
I should be allowed
to get divorced.

666
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,039
Except he'd win.
He'd win everything.

667
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,559
He'd get the girls, he'd get
the house, all of his pension.

668
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,559
Why would he win?
Because that's what he's like.

669
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,879
He always has to win.

670
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,279
But if he just wasn't there,

671
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,359
we could just live there.

672
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,799
Me and the girls. And my God,
my life would be so easy.

673
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,279
What would you live on?

674
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,919
Fresh air.

675
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,439
How would you pay the mortgage?

676
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,879
I don't know. I don't care.

677
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,840
I might get away with it.

678
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,519
People know what he's like.
That policewoman did.

679
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,799
She was nearly begging me to shop
him for coercive control.

680
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,720
Why didn't you? Because you said
you were going to help me.

681
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,439
And you know, as soon as
all that officialdom kicks in,

682
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,680
they can take your children off you
like batting an eyelid. So...

683
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,279
I don't know.

684
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,319
I don't know.
Maybe I should go talk to her.

685
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,759
I'm going to have to talk to

686
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,080
one of them anyway when
those drug results come back.

687
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,039
I'm being blackmailed.

688
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,039
That's why it's a struggle

689
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,319
to help you out
just at the moment.

690
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,479
These lads came into the shop.

691
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,519
One of them got me in my little
consulting room and he had a gun.

692
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,799
They want 1,800 quid a week, or...

693
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,919
Are you joking?

694
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,159
They're organised. They threatened
to hurt my family. Shit. Yeah.

695
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,839
Well, can't you go to the police?

696
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,359
How?

697
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,799
When I've been helping
people like you?

698
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,359
As soon as they start sniffing
around, they're going to

699
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,439
lift the lid on stuff I shouldn't
have been doing. So they've got me.

700
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,600
I'm sorry. I wish I could
help you, but I can't.

701
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,440
Rob knows it was you
who gave me that diazepam.

702
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,959
How?

703
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,480
I told him.

704
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,559
Shit. Joanna!

705
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,959
I didn't want to.

706
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,599
But you know, when someone's wanting
to know stuff

707
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,519
and they're punching the crap
out of you until you tell them...

708
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,199
Why didn't you
make something up?

709
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,000
I did to start with, but...

710
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,400
I have thought about
how I'd do it.

711
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,080
If I did kill him.

712
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,999
He drinks.

713
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,959
Despite all his healthy body,
healthy minds stuff,

714
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,959
Friday night, he drinks
himself into a massive stupor.

715
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,319
And I've often thought

716
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,319
if I could just get hold of
some ketamine

717
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,519
and drop it into his drink,

718
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,759
then I could put a cushion
over his face.

719
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,999
Or an injection.

720
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,039
If you inject air into
someone's bloodstream.

721
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,559
Is that true?
That it'll kill them?

722
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,359
Yeah. I think if you got air
in your bloodstream,

723
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,600
you wouldn't be finding
a lot to laugh at.

724
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,519
Perhaps you can help me
with that, then.

725
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,039
If you can't help me with
a little flat.

726
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,519
I don't handle ketamine, Joanna.

727
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,719
It's not a prescription drug.

728
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,079
Well, something else, then.

729
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,920
You're a chemist.

730
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,879
This is very kind of you.

731
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,319
I'm decluttering. Anything you don't
want,

732
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,879
just drop back in the box
and I'll put it on Freecycle.

733
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,359
No, I think I can use all this.

734
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,719
Thanks.

735
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,599
Got you an interview for a job.

736
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,799
When?

737
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,119
It's driving a forklift truck.

738
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,519
No way!

739
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,599
Yeah, you've to ring that
number, give them your name

740
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,079
and then they'll book you in.
Nevison Gallagher? Yeah.

741
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,079
Industrial refrigeration.
It's on the same

742
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,080
industrial estate as
Ramsden's, down here. Oh, I know.

743
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,959
If there's ever anything
I can do for you,

744
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,560
you will let me know, won't you?

745
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,799
Yeah, well, actually - and this
isn't why I've done it

746
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
so do say no if it's not
convenient, but...

747
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,440
if I leave you
my little Ford...

748
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,559
could I borrow your truck for a
couple of hours on Saturday?

749
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,759
As long as you're not doing owt
dodgy in it.

750
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,040

driving lessons.

Can I get driving lessons?
How much are they?

754
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,959
An arm and a leg.
For my birthday?

755
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,959
Dad! Hmm? Oh. We'll have to see.
What do you mean?

756
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,640
I mean, we'll have to see.

757
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,719
Have you been following my son

758
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,119
as well as my daughters?

759
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,799
I only ask because I'd love to
know what the little sod

760
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,080
gets up to when he's
supposed to be at school.

761
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,680
What's his name?

762
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,520
Tahir.

763
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,200
You haven't got a son, Faisal.

764
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,039
You try and fuck with me again

765
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,279
and I will prove to you

766
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,919
that I know your daughters
better than you do.

767
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,679
HE SUCKS TEETH

768
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,280
Especially that eldest one, eh?

769
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,039
Next week, yeah? Oh, and it'll be
Thursday, not Wednesday.

770
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,640
I'm getting married on Wednesday.

771
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,240
You not going to congratulate me?

772
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,439
Congratulations.

773
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,039
Nice.

774
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,479
And next week, cos you tried
to fuck with me, I want this

775
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,159
plus another 1,500. No, I can't do
that. Oh, you can.

776
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,119
You'd be silly not to. I told you,
the police might be onto me.

777
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,799
How?

778
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,519
Hmm? Eh?

779
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,599
How?

780
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,759
This... woman I gave
a few pills to got arrested,

781
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,999
and the pills were confiscated
by the police.

782
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,159
And she's not told them
where she got them from,

783
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,319
but I worry that she will.

784
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,879
She has to go back when the
tests on the drugs come back.

785
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,959
And I worry... that she's flaky

786
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,799
and that she could say anything,

787
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,960
and she reckons she's told her
husband, and he could, too.

788
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,239
Well, sort them out.

789
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,440
Both of them.

790
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,479
How?

791
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,239
That's not my problem.

792
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,600
And if it becomes my problem, well,
like I say...

793
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,759
wouldn't take much to
persuade me to go say hello

794
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,120
to that eldest one of yours.

795
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,920

You back on t'team? Yeah.

799
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,479
He asked me yesterday.
Last minute. Only cos

800
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,279
he couldn't find anyone else
daft enough to do it.

801
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,599
Was he all right wi' you?
Yeah.

802
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,040
Can I eat this pizza cold?

cheese poisoning? I doubt it.
Who are you playing?

807
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,759
Hipperholme.
There or here?

working this Saturday.

Well, I was supposed to be,
but I'm not now, so...

811

Do you want me to come?

812
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,919
You don't have to. I texted
Clare about it last night

813
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,479
and she was fine with it.

814
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,839
So, we might drive into Leeds
and look at some shops, so...

815
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,280
you can play with your Land Rover.

He's playing football. They
should be finishing any time,

I don't know.

822
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,599
I forgot to tell you, because
the clutch is knackered,

823
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,359
you need to double declutch

I'm in a coffee shop. Are you?

They wanted to look round Game,

and they can spend hours
in there, them two,

00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,720
Nothing, really. I was just...

864
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
ringing to find out
how you'd gone on.

865
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,519
Oh, you mean with that Hepworth?

866
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,079
Er...

867
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,639
he were fine.

868
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,919
There were no incidents,
no nasty comments.

869
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,879
Not that I know of. I didn't see
much of him, to be honest.

870
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,080
What did you say to him?

871
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,480
Nothing much.

872
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,399
I think Ryan's little old granny

873
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,759
turning up dressed like
RoboCop didn't compute,

874
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,320
so his undercarriage fell off.

875
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,080
You at a loose end?

876
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,200
No.

877
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,440
I hate Leeds.

878
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,519
Do you?

879
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,400
Don't know why we come.
I'd rather be at home.

880
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,240
Mm.

881
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,559
Is there owt else?

882
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,639
Only I've got a moderately
interesting looking sandwich

883
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,239
staring at me and it won't

884
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,080
get out of its bit of packaging all
by itself.

885
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,519
No.

886
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,280
No, I was just...

887
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,040
Yeah, wondering
how you'd gone on.

888
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,639
So, I'll see you when I see you.

889
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,720
Yep.

890
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,200
When you get back from Leeds.

891
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,160
OK. Ta-ta.

892
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,240
Bye-bye.

893
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,400
