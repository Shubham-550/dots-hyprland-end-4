1
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:13,681


3
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:16,561
How do?

4
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,361
<i>So I need you to authorise</i>

5
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,641
<i>the recovery of a vehicle
for me and Gorkem,</i>

6
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:22,801
<i>and then send another vehicle
to come pick us up.</i>

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:24,921
Really? Why?
What's happened?

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,161
<i>So, right...</i>

9
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:28,201
So you know you said not to
park right next to the flats,

10
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,801
and we weren't going to,
obviously...

11
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:31,041
But you did.

12
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:33,761
<i>Well, it was either that
or parking half a mile off</i>

13
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:36,001
and frogmarching these two
halfway across Sowerby Bridge.

14
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,361
And we wouldn't want you
to wear your little legs out.

15
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:39,561
<i>So we've... No.</i>

16
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:41,721
So we've gone in,
we've arrested him,

17
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,161
we're only in there
three minutes, then...

18
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,361
...we've come outside...

19
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:45,721
I take it we're talking about

20
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,401
the phantom fridge-thrower
again.

21
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:49,401
It's a microwave this time.

22
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:50,801
<i>Oh!</i>

23
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:53,441
- He's diversifying.
- Any available units,

24
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:54,681
<i>is anyone in the vicinity</i>

25
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:56,121
<i>- of Baitings Dam?</i>
- Hang <i>on,</i> Shaf.

26
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:57,321
I'm up that way, Control.

27
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:58,841
<i>Is that you,
Mrs Cawood?</i>

28
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:01,521
It is! How's yourself,
Mr Robertshaw?

29
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:03,601
<i>I'm very fair, thanks,
Mrs Cawood.</i>

30
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:05,041
<i>Now, I've got a report in
from some...</i>

31
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:07,641
<i>I think they're, like,
Yorkshire Water people.</i>

32
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:10,401
<i>- They've found some bones.</i>
- <i>Oh, fair</i> enough.

33
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:12,521
<i>They've been draining
t'reservoir for maintenance</i>

34
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:14,841
<i>and a skeleton's popped up,
apparently.</i>

35
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,361
On my way-

36
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,161
Six minutes.

37
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:21,321
Right, Shaf.

38
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,681
I'll authorise
your recovery vehicle,

39
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,041
but you'll have to sort it out
with Control

40
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:26,721
<i>about getting picked up.</i>

41
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:28,601
<i>Or you could speak
to Inspector Taylor</i>

42
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,761
<i>and get him to sort you out.</i>

43
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,041
I'm sure he'll be even more

44
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:32,961
amused and delighted about it
than I am.

45
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:34,081


46
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:46,761
Turned out nice again.

47
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,201
That's it there.

48
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,321
Is it a sheep?

49
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,281
I think
it's an alien life-form.

50
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:53,801
We get a good few sightings
of 'em round here.

51
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,201
What, sheep?

52
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:57,681
No, aliens.

53
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,161
9675 to Control.

54
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,241
It's human remains.

55
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:41,481
<i>Copy that, 9675. We'll get
the on-call SIO down</i>

56
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:42,921
<i>and send a log across to CSI.</i>

57
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:45,881
- Catherine.
- Sir.

58
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,081
What do you know?

59
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,801
Torso. Skeleton.

60
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:52,361
Head, no hands.

61
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,081
Nothing below the waist.

62
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,041
I think he's been there
seven and a half, eight years.

63
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,281
Oh, really? Well, we'll let
the Home Office pathologist

64
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:00,841
decide that, shall we?

65
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:02,681
If you like, sir. As you wish.

66
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,081
Heard you're retiring
this year.

67
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,481
Yeah.

68
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:09,081
Seven months,
one week, three days.

69
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:10,681
- Teeth intact?
-Mm?

70
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,281
Oh, er, yeah.

71
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:16,161
And he's got a metal plate
on the right clavicle,

72
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:18,121
very similar to me own,
except mine's on the left.

73
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,761
What are you doing with
a metal plate, Catherine?

74
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:23,121
Oh, it's a long story, sir,
from a distant altercation.

75
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:25,081
His is newer than mine.

76
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,361
Oh, you've decided it's a he,
have you?

77
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:28,441
What's his favourite sandwich?

78
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:29,921
Shouldn't think we'll have

79
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,361
too much trouble
identifying him -

80
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,481
her, whoever -
if there's teeth.

81
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,121
You won't have any trouble
at all, sir.

82
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,441
It's Gary Gackowski.

83
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:40,401
He fell off a third-floor
balcony down at

84
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:42,801
Upshaw House in Elland
about nine, ten years ago,

85
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:44,321
when he was off his head
on M-CAT.

86
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:46,321
Shattered his collarbone.

87
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,121
And I'd recognise those teeth
anywhere.

88
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,961
I nicked him once for a public
order of fence and he bit me.

89
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,401
Went missing
about 18 months later.

90
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:56,201
That was seven and a half,
eight years since.

91
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,881
People used to say he'd upset
someone he shouldn't have

92
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,521
and been buried in concrete
underpants up at Scammonden,

93
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,041
but happen they were wrong, eh?

94
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,601
This is Baitings.

95
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:09,201
You might find his legs are
in that blue thing over there.

96
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:11,241
I'll leave it with you.

97
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:13,801
Twats.

98
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,441


99
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,601


100
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:17,921
Tommy, lad,
you've got visitors.

101
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:38,121
Tommy Lee Royce?

102
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:42,161
- How do?
- We're from H-Met.

103
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,521
We're arresting you
on suspicion of the murder

104
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:48,561
of Gary James Gackowski
on or around April 2014.

105
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,801
For the tape,

106
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,641
I'm showing Tommy a photo
of the deceased.

107
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:38,561
Do you recognise him?

108
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:39,681
No.

109
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:44,641
No.

110
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:46,601
Can you tell me
if you were involved

111
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:49,401
- in the murder of this man?
- I wasn't.

112
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:52,361
Can you cast your mind back
eight years

113
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:55,121
and tell me if you know
or knew of anyone

114
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,281
who was involved in the murder
of this man?

115
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:58,601
I don't.

116
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:01,241
Have you ever talked to anyone
about any involvement

117
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:03,441
you may have had
in the death of this man?

118
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:04,881
No.

119
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,121
Do you know a lad called
Nazam Miraf?

120
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:12,441
He's on the same floor as me
at Sheffield.

121
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:14,921
How would you respond, Tommy,
if I told you

122
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,841
that Naz - Nazam -

123
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:19,721
has told us that you told him

124
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:22,401
that you were involved
in the murder of

125
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:24,801
"that lad they found buried
in concrete

126
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,361
"in that dam up Ripponden"?

127
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:27,481


128
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:29,761
Why would I be telling him owt?

129
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:32,081
<i>What would your reaction be,
Tommy, if I told you</i>

130
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,841
<i>that he told us certain things</i>

131
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,321
that were done to this lad,
to this Gary,

132
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,001
and that he says you told him,

133
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,921
and they were never made known
to the public?

134
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,281
I'd say happen it's him you
need to be chatting to, not me.

135
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:46,041
Except he was inside
when Gary disappeared.

136
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:51,321
Well, then he's mixing me up
with somebody else, then.

137
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:54,761
Either that
or he's making stuff up.

138
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:56,601
Doing a bit of grassing,
get himself a text

139
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:58,241
and a few privileges, eh?

140
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:14,961


141
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:18,401
This way.

142
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:37,761


143
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:40,641
Have you had something to eat?

144
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:43,921
Yeah, I've had a sandwich
and a wee-wee.

145
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:46,721
Do you want to sit?

146
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:57,321
They've made
further disclosures.

147
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:59,721
And what they're saying now

148
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,481
is that as well as
this Nazam Miraf,

149
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,801
you also told
the prison chaplain

150
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:06,041
three months ago,

151
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,681
before the body was found,

152
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,841
that you were there when
this Gackowski lad was murdered

153
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:12,401
and that you helped dispose of
his body in the reservoir.

154
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:15,041


155
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,001
No comment.

156
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:27,361
Naz, as you say, might be
hoping for some privileges,

157
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:32,121
but for this chaplain
to tell us the same tale,

158
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:34,241
the exact same tale...

159
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:36,721
That's what's ringing
alarm bells for us, Tommy.

160
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:39,081
Yeah, well, they're colluding,
aren't they?

161
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:40,641
Come on, wakey-wakey.

162
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:42,881
Yes, but why?
Why would they do that?

163
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,681
I don't know. No comment.

164
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,361
Because they don't like me.

165
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:50,201
I mean, apart from the fact
that, as we've established,

166
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:51,801
they don't even
know each other.

167
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,481
Hmm?

168
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:59,841
Naz has never spoken to this
prison chaplain in question,

169
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,121
he's never once met him.

170
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,241
So why would this chaplain,

171
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:06,961
a bloke who you've told us
is a friend of yours,

172
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,961
a good friend,
why is he coming to us

173
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,921
with almost exactly
the same tale, hmm?

174
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,361
Unless it's true.

175
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:28,441
Have you ever worn
a St Christopher, Tommy?

176
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,881
A St Christopher.

177
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,921
A necklace with, like,
a St Christopher on it.

178
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,281
- No.
- You have.

179
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:38,361
Cast your mind back.

180
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:41,601
Last time you were in prison,
when you went down in 2006,

181
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:43,561
you were wearing
a St Christopher.

182
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,041
It was logged in your property.
Do you remember?

183
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:47,321
- Hold up.
- It's OK.

184
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,081
What, 16 years ago?

185
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:55,041
No, I don't.

186
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:58,921
It was returned to you
when you left in 2014.

187
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,441
- Can you describe it for me?
- I don't...

188
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,001
- Was it gold or silver or...?
- Er...

189
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:04,961
Can you tell me
what happened to it?

190
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,401
- No.
- Did you lose it?

191
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,041
- I don't know owt about it.
- But you did have it.

192
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,521
If that's what
you're telling me.

193
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,481
Do you recognise...

194
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,481
- ...this St Christopher?
- That's not

195
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,681
- been disclosed.
- Shut up.

196
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:37,001
Are you all right, Tommy?

197
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,721
You seem to have become
very interested

198
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,801
when I've shown you
this St Christopher.

199
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:45,081
Do you recognise it?

200
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,481
No.

201
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:58,401
How would you react, Tommy,

202
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:00,001
if I told you that
this St Christopher

203
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:02,521
was found in the concrete
that was used to weigh down

204
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:04,721
- Gary Gackowski's body?
- You're lying.

205
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:06,401
Is it yours, Tommy?

206
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:09,401
- You planted it.
- No, we didn't.

207
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:11,161
We know it's yours, Tommy.

208
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:16,921
This is the log taken
in the prison in 2006.

209
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,841
It describes a silver-coloured
St Christopher pendant

210
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:23,241
with a V-shaped cut
at five o'clock.

211
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:26,441
We know you were present,
Tommy,

212
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,081
when Gary Gackowski
went into that concrete.

213
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:34,441
Gackowski was shot
with a 9mm Glock,

214
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,281
also recovered
from the reservoir.

215
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,561
Ballistics have told us
it's the same weapon

216
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,281
as was used to shoot Ashley
Cowgill two months later,

217
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:42,961
- in June 2014.
- Oh, aye?

218
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,601
Look, whoever Royce was
working for must have decided

219
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:48,641
the gun was good for another
job, so they've kept it,

220
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,761
used it to shoot
Ashley Cowgill,

221
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,721
then they've gone back
and dumped it in the reservoir.

222
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:55,641
And you think this whoever
is Darius Knezevic?

223
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,721
Him and his brother
on a motorbike.

224
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:03,681
Yeah, before he got too grand
to do his own dirty work

225
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,241
and started getting big ideas
about getting himself elected

226
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:07,681
onto Bradford City Council.

227
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:09,961
Look, this has always been
the intel on the ground.

228
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,041
We just haven't been able
to prove it.

229
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:15,401
I think Royce is this close
to admitting he was present

230
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,841
when Gackowski was shot.

231
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:19,921
And if he does, we're
optimistic he'll name names.

232
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,361
And if he does, we could have

233
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:24,401
Darius Knezevic
on a murder charge,

234
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,681
not just for Gary Gackowski,

235
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:27,881
but for Ashley Cowgill as well.

236
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,601
Finally. At last.

237
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:32,961
And why do you think
someone like Royce

238
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,521
is going to name names?

239
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:38,321
We heard Darius Knezevic
ordered Royce's death.

240
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,321
That's how he got his face
cut up like that.

241
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:43,201
Wasn't meant to just get cut
up, was meant to be dead.

242
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,801
Sorry, ma'am.

243
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:46,841
Sir, Royce wants to make
a statement.

244
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,241
- Well, that was quick.
- Go on, then.

245
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:53,161
<i>"I never at any point foresaw</i>

246
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:55,201
"Gary Gackowski's death.

247
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:57,601
"I understood that what was
being done was a punishment

248
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,841
"to frighten him. And when
the man pulled out the gun

249
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:01,161
"and shot him through the head,

250
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:03,161
"I said,
'What you effing doing?

251
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:05,361
" 'You said you weren't going
to kill him.'

252
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:07,401
"I didn't say much else
because I could see

253
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,801
"he was not the sort of person
to argue with.

254
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:11,841
"I just did what I was told.

255
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,761
<i>"I told him to chuck the gun
in the water, but he refused.</i>

256
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,401
<i>"He said it would be all right
for another job.</i>

257
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:19,601
<i>"I'm keen to state</i>

258
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:21,361
"that when I got involved
in this,

259
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:22,681
"it was on the understanding

260
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,481
"that it was a warning
to the lad.

261
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:28,521
"I did not know it would end
in his death."

262
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,881
When you say he shot him
through the head,

263
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,441
where exactly?

264
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:47,441
And when you say "he",
the man who shot him -

265
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:49,481
have you got a name
for me, Tommy?

266
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,441
Darius Knezevic. Just say it.

267
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:02,881
It were Chris Oxley.

268
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:06,161
Chris Oxley? He runs Oldham.

269
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,281
Shit.

270
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:20,201


271
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:25,481


272
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:37,601


273
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:40,361
What is he doing? Is he blind?

274
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:41,841
That were a golden opportunity.

275
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,441
Come on!

276
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:44,801
Tackle him, you twat!

277
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,761
Oh, my God. Move your legs,
you moron!

278
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,161
Anticipate, anticipate!

279
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:52,001
Where's the defence?!

280
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,481


281
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:59,641
It's gone in again.
How many's that?

282
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:01,081
It's 4-0.

283
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:03,761
Oh, stop it. Poor kid,
he's doing his best.

284
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:05,441
Tell you what, Cawood -

285
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,681
if you spent as much time
concentrating on

286
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:09,801
what you're doing, instead of
all this verbal diarrhoea

287
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,921
aimed at everybody else,
you might do better.

288
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,561
No, it's them up there
you want to be going on at.

289
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:15,521
They don't know what positions
they're in, half of them.

290
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:22,481
You are skating on
very thin ice.

291
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:24,201
You little shit stain.

292
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:29,081
Come on, Ryan, lad! Come on!

293
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:36,641
What did he say to you,
that Mr Hepworth,

294
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:38,041
when you chucked t'ba

 at him?

295
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:39,961
- Oh, nothing.
- Didn't look like nothing.

296
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:41,521
It looked like he upset you.

297
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:44,721
Yeah, well, revenge is a dish
best sewed cold.

298
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,721
- Who's taught you that?
- Saw it in a film.

299
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:50,561
And he's a dog. Everyone knows
he's knocking Mrs Oates off.

300
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:52,241
Is he? Mrs Oates?

301
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:53,801
There's a joke there somewhere.

302
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,401
And he's a shirt lifting
arse-bandit.

303
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:56,641
Oi!

304
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:57,841
Do you want arrested?

305
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:00,081
Because I can arrest people
for talking like that.

306
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:02,001
And he can't <i>be</i> like that

307
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:05,601
if he's knocking off
Mrs Doo-dah.

308
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,761
Unless he's Betty Both-Ways.

309
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:14,081
- 6-0?
- It's not my fault.

310
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,481
Hey, you're the goalie.
Of course it's your fault.

311
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:17,881
See, this is
how people think.

312
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,081
He's teasing you.

313
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:21,001
To be fair,
they were a good side.

314
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,281
I shouldn't even be
in goal.

315
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,401
I should be up front.

316
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:24,881
Then no—one'd get anywhere near
our goal.

317
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:27,161
Well, ask him.
Talk to your teacher.

318
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:28,401
Tell him you want to have a go

319
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:29,641
- at playing up front.
- He should.

320
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:30,761
- You should!
- I have!

321
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,281
He doesn't listen.
He's a self-obsessed tosser.

322
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,161
Oi!

323
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,481
And he's knocking Mrs Oates off

324
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:38,001
when he's not batting for
t'wrong county.

325
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:40,201
- What have I said?
- That's assault!

326
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:42,601
- Yeah? Ring the police.
- Oh, here they are.

327
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,201
Sorry I'm late.

328
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,921
You're just in time.

329
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,841
- Where's Ros?
- Oh, she...

330
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,361
She had a headache, so...

331
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:52,561
Happy birthday, young man!

332
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,401
She sends her apologies.

333
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:56,921
- You doing anything special?
- Yeah.

334
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,481
- This.
- Daniel and Ann,

335
00:18:58,601 --> 00:18:59,801
they got me a voucher

336
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,001
- to go skydiving.
- Wow.

337
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:03,121
- It's tomorrow in Sheffield.
- Is he old enough?

338
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,441
I'm 16!

339
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,761
You're all
as mad as each other,

340
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:07,001
you lot, wanting to do that.

341
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:10,721
Hey. It's good, that. You have
to use your imagination,

342
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:12,321
not just sit in front of
a screen,

343
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:13,921
prodding buttons and shouting.

344
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,361
What are you looking at me
for?

345
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,601
Cos you're as bad as him.
How's the new house?

346
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,361
Oh, we love it.
It needs a lot doing.

347
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:21,681
Grade <i>

</i> listed.

348
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,321
- You're very lucky.
- Well, they both

349
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:24,681
work hard, so...

350
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:26,801
...a

 I need now
is some grandchildren

351
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:27,881
and then we can all relax.

352
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:28,921
Yeah, I'm doing me best.

353
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,601
Yeah, you know all that means,
though, Clare,

354
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:31,641
is that it's falling to bits

355
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:33,721
and you have to do it up like
English Heritage tells you.

356
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,401
She's changing t'subject.

357
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:38,001
It's gorgeous. It's got, like,
wooden doings and...

358
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:40,641
- Really? Wooden doings?
- Beams!

359
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:43,041
Right. Has everyone got
a drink?

360
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:44,201
Richard, what do you fancy?

361
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:47,401
Catherine, whose is that thing
outside?

362
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,761
It's mine. I've just bought it.

363
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:50,081
- What, seriously?
- Mm.

364
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:51,241
You paid money for it?

365
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:52,641
- What is it?
- Have you not seen it?

366
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:54,121
Yeah, I'm going to do it up,

367
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:57,041
and then I'm going to do
what I've always fancied doing.

368
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,841
I'm going to drive
to the Himalayas.

369
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:02,521
What have you bought, Mum?

370
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:07,921
You know most police officers

371
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,361
die within five years of
retirement.

372
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,761
Why?

373
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,361
Because they can't let go.
I don't know.

374
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,761
Cos they've got nothing better
to think about

375
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,841
because the job's made them
all bitter and twisted.

376
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:22,001
Whereas me,
I'm counting the seconds.

377
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,481
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm very proud of me 30 years.

378
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:29,081
I'm the best copper that ever
lived. But Code 1 1 , job done.

379
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:31,841
I think most of them think
that's it, end of,

380
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:33,921
but me, I'm just becoming

381
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,401
the person I've always wanted
to be.

382
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:39,241
Don't take shit off anyone
any more.

383
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:40,841
I say it like it is.

384
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:42,961
I know who I am, finally.

385
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:46,001
And I now know
the be-all and end-all

386
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,481
in't necessarily to get myself
hitched to the first

387
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:50,681
useless flaky twat of a man
who happens along.

388
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,961
Mm. You've always been
like that.

389
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:54,041
Yeah, but I'm feeling it now.

390
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:55,521
Rock on.

391
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:59,001
What else do you fancy doing?
Zumba? Pilates? Yoga?

392
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:00,481
- Fuck off.
- Why?

393
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:01,801
It's dangerous.
Have you never been?

394
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:03,041
Yoga is dangerous?

395
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,281
Somebody came to do a session
for us

396
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,041
up at t'nick one dinner time.

397
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:08,601
We were all farting
like billy-o

398
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:10,001
after the first few moves.

399
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,401
That's not dangerous.

400
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,721
Oh, it is. We gave off
enough methane

401
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,481
to melt a polar icecap.

402
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,681
Greta Thunberg had to come
and speak to us.

403
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,921
We had a flood t'week after,
down Hebden. Do you remember?

404
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,961
Well, that was us lot
cracking off

405
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,561
- up Halifax.
- Who knew?

406
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:25,841
Oh, it might give you
inner peace,

407
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:28,161
but there's whole coastal towns
falling into the sea

408
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:31,521
every time you squeeze yourself
into t'
otus position, so...

409
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:33,201
...don't you talk to me
about yoga

410
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:35,161
and then go voting
for the Green Party.

411
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:37,241
Well, I shall take

412
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:39,601
my well-intended suggestions
elsewhere.

413
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:42,121
Yes, kindly do.

414
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:46,841
Tell you what, though.

415
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:49,041
What?

416
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:51,401
It's Ryan's birthday,
and we're just...

417
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:53,281
---happy. aren't we?

418
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:56,041
We haven't had one bad word.
We're just having a laugh.

419
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:58,281
Yeah.

420
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:02,361
The last few years...
I don't know.

421
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:05,641
It's all seemed a bit easier
somehow, hasn't it?

422
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:08,401
We move on, don't we?
In the end.

423
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:12,521
And he's seemed to
behave himself better

424
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,001
since he moved to Elm Wood.

425
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:16,041
I think that's been
a big thing.

426
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:21,481
I wish I knew what that
Mr Hepworth had said to him

427
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,401
when he went up to him
in goal.

428
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,441
He called him
a little shit stain.

429
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,761
You see, this is the thing.

430
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:35,241
I never know when to tell you
stuff and when not to.

431
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:37,801
He told me when you were busy
in t'kitchen.

432
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,521
I know. Bastard.

433
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:43,921
Wants his card marking,
that one.

434
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:51,121
- Here, look, it's Joe.
- Who the hell's Joe?

435
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:52,881
- Joe Mamma.
- You twat.

436
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,001
- You're a twat.
- He's a twat.

437
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:56,721
Who's a twat?

438
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:57,961
Hepworth.

439
00:22:58,081 --> 00:22:59,841
Oh, yeah. He's a twat.

440
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,561
I dare you to shout,
"Have you had your oats, sir?"

441
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:09,561
Have you had your oats, sir?

442
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,961
You! Cawood! Get back here.

443
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:16,041
Fucking hell, he's going to
chase us!

444
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,921


445
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,601
Yeah.

446
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:27,321
Sorry. Sorry.

447
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:28,361


448
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:29,801
Yes?

449
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,441
Hiya. Is that Rob?

450
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:33,081
It's Leah, Paisley's mum.

451
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:34,481
<i>It is, yes, hello.</i>

452
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:35,761
Look, so I don't mind,
and it's really

453
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,641
not a problem. But just so
you know, I've had to pick up

454
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:39,241
Florence and Poppy again
from school today,

455
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:40,401
<i>which is fine.</i>

456
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,201
<i>It just means that Paisley's
going to be a few minutes late</i>

457
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,441
<i>for her dance class, which,
honestly, it doesn't matter.</i>

458
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:47,241
<i>It's just Joanna, I'm just
a little bit worried about her.</i>

459
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:49,041
It's like the fourth time that
she's rung me last minute,

460
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,641
you know, to ask me
to pick them up and...

461
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,161
Well, look, I really don't want

462
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,001
to say anything out of turn,
but...

463
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,441
...is she drinking?

464
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:04,241
<i>Rob, are you still there?</i>

465
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:07,281


466
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:24,081


467
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:33,881
- You had a good day?
- Yeah.

468
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:38,201
- Where's Mummy?
- Bed.

469
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:39,761
Take your coat off, Poppy.

470
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:44,241


471
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:49,721
I, er...

472
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:52,201
I just had a nap. I'm just
going to go and make tea.

473
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,681
That Leah rang. Said she had to
pick up the girls from school.

474
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:57,201
Yeah, I just felt a bit
headachey. She didn't mind.

475
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:58,721
Said it were the fourth...
She did mind.

476
00:24:58,841 --> 00:24:59,921
She asked me

477
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,481
- if you'd been drinking.
- Drinking?

478
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,481
- Are you on something?
- No.

479
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,921
You look like you've taken
something. Have you been to see

480
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,401
- that fucking doctor again?
- No!

481
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,961
I just felt a bit
under the weather so I...

482
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,361
If I find out that
you've been taking

483
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:12,401
them stupid little pills again,
there's going to be trouble,

484
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:14,161
because we've had
this conversation.

485
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,841
I haven't been to the doctor.

486
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:17,521
Well, you look like...

487
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,041
I can see when you've been
taking something.

488
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:20,241
- Where is it?
- What?

489
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:22,281
I'm gonna speak to that doctor.

490
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,041
- I haven't been to the doctor.
- So what have you taken?

491
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,041
Nothing!

492
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:27,881
I just needed a lie down
because I had a headache!

493
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:29,401
It's more than just a lie down,
innit,

494
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:31,481
when you can't pick up
your own children from school,

495
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:33,041
and not for the first time!

496
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:35,481
Perhaps you don't realise how
obvious it is to other people!

497
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,681
Rob, don't do...

498
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:39,281


499
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:40,761
Happy?

500
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:41,841
I'll go get tea on.

501
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:43,281
Come here.
Empty your pockets.

502
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:44,561
No, I'm not emptying
my pockets!

503
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:45,841
Rob! Get off me!

504
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,521
Rob, get off me! Rob!

505
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:51,521
Come here.

506
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,241
- No, wait, no, no, no.
- Come here.

507
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:54,521
- Rob, no.
- Come here.

508
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:56,201
Rob! Stop!

509
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,881
Stop it!

510
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:59,161
Rob, no!

511
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:02,281
No!

512
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:06,641
Where have these come from?
Hey?

513
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:08,041
Who gave them to you?

514
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:09,321
How many have you taken?

515
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:12,361
- How many have you taken?
- Two!

516
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:14,161
Well, there's nine missing
from this packet,

517
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,281
so how long have you had 'em?

518
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:16,681
Do you know, all of us,

519
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,561
all your family,
me, your mum, your dad,

520
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:20,121
all your family,
we all thought that

521
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,001
you'd weaned yourself off
this nonsense.

522
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,281
Yes, well, I've been
struggling.

523
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:24,481
Struggfing?

524
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:25,601
When?!

525
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:27,681
And if you're struggling,
you talk to someone.

526
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:28,921
And where have you got them
from?

527
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,201
Have you got them
on prescription?

528
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:32,001
No! No.

529
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:33,641
- They're...
- What, are they knock-off?

530
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:35,601
You mean they're illegal?
Well, then, perhaps I ought to

531
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,361
ring 999. What do you think?
Think I should do that?

532
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:39,281
They're not illegal, Rob,
it's diazepam!

533
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:42,761
They're illegal if you haven't
got a prescription for them.

534
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:45,081
If you haven't got them
on prescription,

535
00:26:45,201 --> 00:26:46,761
you've got no idea
where they've come from,

536
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,321
or what's in them.

537
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,881
How dare you bring this filth
into my house?

538
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,881
What, are you not thinking?

539
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:55,561
What if one of the girls
had found them? What if

540
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,561
they'd eaten some of them
thinking they were sweets?

541
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:59,641
See, this is why you can't be
trusted with anything.

542
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:01,641
Where?
Where did you get 'em?

543
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:03,841
Who gave them to you?

544
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:06,641
Jesus Christ.

545
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:09,841
You're not even worth fucking.

546
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:12,521
Right. Well, you might not want
to tell me,

547
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:13,921
but you'll have to tell
the police.

548
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,921
I'm sure they'll be fascinated
to know all about

549
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:17,241
- where they've come from.
- Wait, Rob!

550
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:18,641
Rob, wait!

551
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:24,641
<i>...which service
do you require?</i>

552
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:26,001
Police.

553
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:27,961
<i>Putting you through.
Hold the line.</i>

554
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:30,761
Rob Hepworth.

555
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,081
<i>And your address, Rob?</i>

556
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,761
<i>22</i> Holywell Avenue.

557
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:38,561
<i>Postcode?</i>

558
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:41,121
HX4 9RK.

559
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,841
Yes, I can.

560
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:46,881
So, sadly,
what's happened is...

561
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,081


562
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:23,201


563
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,001
Mr Hepworth?

564
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,441
I recognised his name
on the box when it came up,

565
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:29,561
so I thought, "Aye-aye,

566
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:31,241
"I'll have a look at this one
myself."

567
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,321
Didn't recognise me.
Not a flicker.

568
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:35,001
How many times have I stood
at the side

569
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:38,161
of that fucking football field
frozen daft?

570
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,681
Anyhow, I didn't say owt.

571
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,561
Where have you been?
I rang over five hours ago.

572
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:43,961
Been a very busy night, sir.

573
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:45,641
Yeah, but if you ring 999,

574
00:28:45,761 --> 00:28:46,881
you expect someone to turn up.

575
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:48,361
You don't expect
to be kept waiting.

576
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:51,401
We've had a major incident
to deal with in Littleborough,

577
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,401
so I've had to send most
of my team off over the border

578
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:54,641
to assist our colleagues.

579
00:28:54,761 --> 00:28:57,081
And then, would you believe,

580
00:28:57,201 --> 00:29:00,081
we've had a fatal collision
up Pellon Lane. Two dead.

581
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:03,281
Now, the operator
you spoke to

582
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:05,201
ascertained that there was
no-one unconscious,

583
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,281
no-one not breathing, no-one
in need of an ambulance

584
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:09,281
and no-one's life in danger.
Is that correct?

585
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:10,881
- Yeah, but...
- So strictly speaking,

586
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,281
that's not a 999 call.

587
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,441
Just FYI, that's a 101 call.

588
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:16,601
But on the plus side,
you've got a sergeant,

589
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,361
you've got a very experienced
sergeant

590
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:20,881
to help sort it all out, so...

591
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,921
...do you want to tell me
what's happened?

592
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,521
Where are we going?

593
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:25,921
Through here?

594
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,441
So I stepped in.

595
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:28,721
She's sat at the kitchen table.

596
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:30,241
But do you know
the oddest thing?

597
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:31,321
Hi, love.

598
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:32,441
Hi.

599
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,761
You all on a diet?

600
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:40,561
I could do with a padlock
on my fridge.

601
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:43,321
Oh, it's just a bit of fun.

602
00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:45,001
Food is fuel.

603
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:47,561
I'm teaching my little girls
about the importance

604
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:49,881
of a nutritious
and well-balanced diet.

605
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:51,721
With a padlock?

606
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:54,801
And then I notice
he's all Nikes and Adidas,

607
00:29:54,921 --> 00:29:56,201
she's in Primark.

608
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:58,201
He's built like
a brick shit house

609
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:00,081
and she's this pasty little
pale thing

610
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:01,281
with all bruises up her arms.

611
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:04,961
So this is my wife Jo.

612
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:06,681
And earlier this evening,
Sergeant...

613
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:07,841
They've had to send

614
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:09,721
a sergeant.
When I got in from work,

615
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:14,921
I found her with what appear
to be prescription drugs.

616
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,841
But whatever they are,
I don't think

617
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,361
she actually got them
with a prescription.

618
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:20,121
So you rang the police
on your own wife?

619
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:21,441
What genre of twat does that?

620
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:22,721
- What's your name, love?
- It's Jo.

621
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:24,561
-Joanna.
- Are these yours?

622
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:25,561
Yes.

623
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:27,681
- These yours, Joanna?
- Yes.

624
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,561
Do you know what they are?

625
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:32,041
It's diazepam.

626
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:33,281
Is it, Jo?

627
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,361
Joanna?

628
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:36,601
Do you have a prescription
for it?

629
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:37,641
No, she hasn't.

630
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,281
Did you have a prescription
for it, Jo?

631
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:46,761
Because you need a prescription
if it's diazepam.

632
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:47,881
I...

633
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,961
I did have a prescription
for diazepam.

634
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:52,081
No, she didn't.

635
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:53,641
A few months ago I did.

636
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:55,641
She had it briefly
on prescription

637
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:57,761
because she had
a few issues

638
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:01,881
at one stage, but she dealt
with it very admirably.

639
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:04,401
And I'm a teacher.
I have my job to think about.

640
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:06,721
I can't have anything illegal
going on in my private life,

641
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:08,401
and Joanna knows that.

642
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:12,001
But these you haven't got on
prescription, is that correct?

643
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,721
- Yeah. No...
- Ask her where she got them.

644
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:16,241
I found them.

645
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:18,721
Where did you find them?

646
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,721
Ask her where she found them.

647
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:31,801
I am sorry, Jo, but I'm going
to have to arrest you.

648
00:31:31,921 --> 00:31:33,761
- Oh, good Lord.
- On suspicion

649
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,481
of possession
of controlled drugs.

650
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:36,601
Do you understand?

651
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:38,201
You... You'll have to

652
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:40,121
give me a few minutes to phone
my mother

653
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:41,681
to come across from Siddal,
Sergeant.

654
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,841
I've got two little girls
asleep.

655
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:45,321
- I can't just leave them.
- You don't have to

656
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:47,801
say anything, all right, love?
But it may harm your defence

657
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,201
if you do not mention
when questioned

658
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:50,841
something that you
later rely on in court.

659
00:31:50,961 --> 00:31:52,241
All right?
Do you understand that?

660
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:53,321
Yeah, Mum?

661
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:55,081
Sorry. Were you in bed?

662
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:56,521
Yeah.

663
00:31:56,641 --> 00:31:58,241
- Could you pop across?
- Have you got a coat, love?

664
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:01,041
I'm not going to cuff you.
No-one's here to humiliate you.

665
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:05,521
Up you get, sweetie.

666
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:08,081
There's no need to get
your mother out of bed.

667
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,601
Follow on if you like,
but there's really no need.

668
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,481
Hang on, Mum. Sorry. No,
I'll jump in the car with you.

669
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,001
No, you won't.
I'm not a taxi service

670
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:16,321
and you're not under arrest.

671
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:18,921
Like I say, you can follow on
if you want, but you'll only

672
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,121
be sat in Reception,
because there'll be nobody

673
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:22,801
in the interview room
except me and her.

674
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:25,481
I can get someone to phone you
when she wants picking up,

675
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:27,281
but it'll be past midnight.

676
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:29,561
Yeah, now, Mum. Now.

677
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,201
I tried to get her talking
in the car,

678
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:32,841
but I couldn't get a peep
out of her.

679
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:34,001
Normally they talk.

680
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:36,721
Normally when you get 'em away
from a fella like him,

681
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:38,241
they can't talk fast enough.

682
00:32:39,401 --> 00:32:40,641
<i>But nothing.</i>

683
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:52,001
So, Joanna, I'm going to
release you on bail.

684
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:54,961
Does that mean I can go home?

685
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:56,281
It does.

686
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:00,281
Is that all right?

687
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,361
Er. . .yeah.

688
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:07,801
Er...

689
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,881
...thank you.

690
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:17,361
These will go off
for forensic tests, and...

691
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:19,721
...depending on what comes
back from the lab,

692
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:22,161
a decision will be made about
any charges then.

693
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:23,521
All right?

694
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:25,681
How long will that take?

695
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,601
About a week or so.

696
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:30,161
W-Will I go to prison?

697
00:33:30,281 --> 00:33:31,521
No, love.

698
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:34,961
Not for a first of fence.

699
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:39,601
<i>I could have let her go with
a caution if she'd given me</i>

700
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:41,761
a <i>straight tale about where she
got them, but she wouldn't.</i>

701
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:43,961
She stuck to this fucking
rubbish that she'd found them

702
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:45,281
on the floor
behind some toilet.

703
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:47,321
Well, there'll be somebody
she's frightened of.

704
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:48,361
Oh, yeah.

705
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:50,441
And then I asked her about
these marks on her arms,

706
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,721
like I didn't know, and
surprise, surprise, it was him.

707
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:54,121
And then I got
some of the story.

708
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,201
It's depression,
anxiety, panic attacks.

709
00:33:56,321 --> 00:33:58,361
Doctor put her on a short
course of diazepam,

710
00:33:58,481 --> 00:33:59,921
and four months on,
she's hooked,

711
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,521
only he won't prescribe
any more.

712
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,321
And she's got cramps, nausea,

713
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,481
palpitations,
more panic attacks.

714
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:07,361
I said, "You want to speak
to my sister.

715
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:08,641
"She runs a group
for people..."

716
00:34:08,761 --> 00:34:10,481
Did you tell her we get
more people turning up

717
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:12,601
addicted to prescription drugs
than we do heroin?

718
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:14,801
Yeah.
And I tried to explain to her,

719
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:17,481
well, very carefully,
what coercive control is

720
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:20,241
and how not normal it is
to live like that.

721
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:22,321
And I offered to take her
to the Safeguarding Unit,

722
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:24,521
but she won't go
because of the girls, which...

723
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:26,121
Yeah, well.

724
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:28,761
She's got no money and she
never sees her mum and dad

725
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:30,201
because he don't like 'em.

726
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:33,201
And same with her friends -
well, she has none any more.

727
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,801
I just said, "Let me help you.
He's isolated you,

728
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:37,241
"he's infantilised you."

729
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:40,041
But you know, you can only
lead a horse to water.

730
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,881
She says, "
'

 have to go.

731
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,521
"He'll be waiting for me
in Reception,"

732
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:45,241
which, lo and behold, he was.

733
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,321
Creepy to think he teaches
our Ryan, though, eh?

734
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:52,961
Oh, yeah. Well, next time
I'm stood at the side

735
00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:55,681
of that football field,
I'll make myself known to him.

736
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:56,841
That'll shock him.

737
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,681
Right. OK.

738
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:01,721
You just wait for me there.

739
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,601
That's it.

740
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:06,081
Get yourself in there, love.

741
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:10,081
That's it, love. Pop your hand
through there. That's it.

742
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:11,361
Lunch boxes.

743
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:13,681
That's yours, in't it, love?

744
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,401
Start again.
What you saying?

745
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:31,481
Last night, right,
at that house down there,

746
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:34,081
a police car showed up, right?
And about 20 minutes later,

747
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:35,321
the woman got put
in the back of it.

748
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:36,361
Which house?

749
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:38,081
That one, with the red Audi.

750
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:39,321
Which woman?

751
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:41,401
That one with
them two little girls.

752
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:43,281
- When was this?
- Last night.

753
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:45,081
- Yeah - what time?
- I don't know.

754
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:47,201
Ten, 11, half 11 ish.

755
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:49,121
And she got put in the back
of a police car?

756
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:50,121
Yes!

757
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:51,681
Oh, my God.
Has she murdered him?

758
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:53,241
Like arrested?

759
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:54,921
" Dad!
_

760
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,161
You're sat on my homework!

761
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,401
- I feel sorry for them kids.
- Oh, sorry.

762
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:58,881
<i>Those kids.</i>

763
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:01,161
The littlest one,
that Poppy one?

764
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:02,601
She never takes her coat off.

765
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:04,241
Mum!

766
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:06,521
Dad squashed my chemistry
with his skinny fat bottom,

767
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:08,601
and I spent nearly half an hour
doing that last night.

768
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:10,161
So are you saying...?

769
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:13,281
She got put in the back of
a police car.

770
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:28,081


771
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:02,281


772
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:13,561
- Hiya.
- I've only got ten minutes.

773
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:14,681
I heard Haniya this...

774
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,281
...morning saying she saw you

775
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,801
go off in a police car
last night.

776
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:19,041
Yeah. It was him. He rang 999.

777
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:20,401
Why?

778
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,921
He found some of the pills
that you're giving me.

779
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,441
- How?
- Well, just...

780
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:24,641
So where are they now?

781
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:25,841
He gave them to the police.

782
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:27,001
Are you kidding me?!

783
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,841
They'll not be able to trace it
back to you, will they?

784
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:30,761
Did you get rid of
all the packaging?

785
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,001
- Yeah.
- All of it?

786
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:34,721
- Yeah.
- Are you...

787
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:36,921
Are you sure? This is serious!

788
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,001
I'm sure.

789
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:39,841
- So what did they take?
- Just the pills.

790
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:41,321
In what? In...

791
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:42,481
Little bag, a little bag

792
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:44,241
- that I had.
- This is important, Joanna.

793
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:45,401
That's how they trace stuff.

794
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:47,321
I'm not stupid.

795
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,561
What a pig, ringing the police.
You're his wife!

796
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:52,881
I've kept telling you.

797
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:56,401
So what did you tell them
about where you got 'em?

798
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:58,801
I just said that I found them

799
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:00,161
on the floor behind a toilet
in a pub.

800
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:02,121
- Did they believe you?
- I don't know.

801
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:04,521
She wrote it down,
the policewoman did,

802
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:06,681
and she seemed more interested
in what a bastard he was

803
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,641
- than anything else.
- So, so...

804
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:10,001
...what did they charge you
with?

805
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,481
Nothing yet. They have to wait
for the pills to come back

806
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:14,841
from being, I don't know,
analysed.

807
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:16,401
They won't be able to
trace it back to you

808
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:17,521
like that, will they?

809
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,921
Not without the packaging.
And you definitely took them

810
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:22,161
out the little blister packs
as well as the boxes?

811
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,081
Yeah.

812
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,801
Right. I better go.

813
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:30,561
Can you...

814
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:32,921
Can you get me some more?

815
00:38:37,801 --> 00:38:40,321
I'll pop them out for you.
Have you got something

816
00:38:40,441 --> 00:38:41,681
to put them in?

817
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:53,961
Do you, erm...
Do you want to go to bed?

818
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,641
No, you're all right.

819
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:58,401
I've got to get to work.

820
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,001
Right.

821
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:07,841


822
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:41,161
Mr Brooks is here for
his prescription, Mr Bhatti.

823
00:39:44,121 --> 00:39:45,921
Do you want to come through,
Ezra?

824
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:54,641
There you go.

825
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:56,921
1,200 quid.

826
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:09,001
You do always get rid of
all the packaging properly,

827
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:10,961
don't you?
Before you give it to people.

828
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:12,201
Do you think I'm thick?

829
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:15,001
No, I just...

830
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,201
You having a bad day?

831
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:20,001
No.

832
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,881
I've got three more people
interested. Clientele.

833
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:27,521
I could do another, oh,
120 jellies next week.

834
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:30,361
I think moderation
is the thing.

835
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:31,601
All right?

836
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,841
You're a Good Samaritan,
Mr Bhatti.

837
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:42,521
You make the world
a better place.

838
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:44,641
Mm.

839
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:51,801
This is the way.

840
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:54,401
OK.

841
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,441
- Morning, love.
- You all right?

842
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:45,361
- Grappo
o's.
- No.

843
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:47,001
- Yeah, I'll book it.
- Don't!

844
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:48,641
- <i>
'

</i> book Abba.
- OK.

845
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:51,161
- Oh, seriously?
- Yeah, book who you like.

846
00:41:51,281 --> 00:41:52,801
I'll be at home
having a cup of tea.

847
00:41:52,921 --> 00:41:55,121
Oh, for God's sake,
what's up with you?

848
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:57,241
Well, you didn't have
a retirement do!

849
00:41:57,361 --> 00:41:58,561
I haven't retired!

850
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:00,321
From being a copper, you did.

851
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:02,001
I think we had
a little drinks do.

852
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:03,921
But I'm not popular
like you are.

853
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,321
I'm not popular.

854
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:06,721
You are!

855
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:08,761
In certain circles you are.

856
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:12,561
They'd probably all
just turn up to take a pop

857
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:14,681
and say good... What do you
mean, in certain circles?

858
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,961
You are popular
in certain circles.

859
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:19,001
Well, in what circles
am I not popular?

860
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:20,881
I don't know. You tell me.

861
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:22,601
You're the one saying
you're not popular.

862
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:24,601
Yeah, but who were you
thinking of when...?

863
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:25,801
- Nobody.
- When you said it?

864
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:27,921
- Nobody!
- Well, who was on your mind?

865
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,681
Well, there's a few top brass
you've pissed off

866
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:32,041
over the years, aren't there?

867
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:33,761
There was that time
that you told Mike Taylor

868
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:36,041
to shove his pips up his arse.

869
00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:38,001
Think that might have been
a game-changer.

870
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,841
Anyway, you're very popular
with...

871
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:47,361
...the troops, the gang,
the rank and file, aren't you?

872
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,121
When you're not upsetting them.

873
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:52,881
I've just done my job.

874
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,241
I've toughened them up.

875
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:56,361
I'm sorry if that makes me
unpopular.

876
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,401
You didn't have

877
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:00,321
- a little drinks do.
- I did!

878
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:02,041
Well, I don't remember
coming.

879
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:03,041
Were you sulking?

880
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:05,281
It's either that
or you didn't invite me.

881
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:06,881
Why would I not invite you?

882
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,401
Of course I invited you.

883
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:09,721
I don't think you did, Joyce.

884
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:11,281
Oh...

885
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:12,561
Just forget it.

886
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:15,641
OK.

887
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:17,561
It's a wonder you have
any friends at all.

888
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:19,161
Well, I don't,
according to you.

889
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:21,681
According to you,
I'm Billy fucking No-Mates.

890
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:23,121
God, you're hard work.

891
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:25,001
- Catherine?
- Mike!

892
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:26,561
- Got a minute?
- Not really, but seeing as

893
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:28,881
it's you and given that I need
all the friends I can get...

894
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:31,801
- Oh, for fuck's...
- All right, Joyce?

895
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:35,441
I never know whether she's
joking or just being a pillock.

896
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:36,921
Have you booked Grappo
o's?

897
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:37,921
No, I haven't.

898
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:39,441
Do you want me to?

899
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:42,081
Well, if you've got the stamina
and the determination,

900
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:43,761
you knock yourself out, chuck.

901
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:45,321
Sit down.

902
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:46,761
I've had a phone call.

903
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:49,201
Might be nothing.

904
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:51,041
Are you going to give me
some clues?

905
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,921
Samantha Greenwood.
Do you know her?

906
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,401
She's the prison liaison
officer at Dewsbury.

907
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:56,481
Do I? I don't know. Probably.

908
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,521
She was at this conference
in Reading last week,

909
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:00,441
week before,
with a lot of other PLOs.

910
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:03,321
And apparently someone said
to her that someone else

911
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,041
had said to them that

912
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:07,801
that Catherine Cawood
must be getting soft,

913
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:10,561
letting her grandson
go visiting Tommy Lee Royce.

914
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:12,721
What?

915
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:14,601
So hang on.

916
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:18,481
Someone else said to
someone else who said to her,

917
00:44:18,601 --> 00:44:19,921
- this Samantha...
- There's her number

918
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,041
if you want to ring her.

919
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:24,361
...that they'd seen Ryan?

920
00:44:24,481 --> 00:44:26,001
No, I don't think
they could have.

921
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,841
I think they must have talked
to a prison officer

922
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:29,001
during a visit to the prison,

923
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:31,001
who must have said he or she,
this prison officer,

924
00:44:31,121 --> 00:44:33,241
had seen Ryan visiting Tommy.

925
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:35,321
So it's fourth-hand
information.

926
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:37,401
It's Chinese whispers,
it's bollocks.

927
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:38,681
That's why I didn't know

928
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,841
whether to say anything
or not. Anyway,

929
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:42,761
- you've got her number.
- I think somebody has got

930
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:44,481
their wires crossed.

931
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,801
How would they know our Ryan,
for starters?

932
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,201
Anyway, how would he get there?

933
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:54,041
He's just gone 16 and he's
really not that well organised.

934
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:56,321
He's only just nicely got
a train to Leeds on his own,

935
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:57,601
well, with Cesco,
and that was a palaver.

936
00:44:57,721 --> 00:44:59,441
How the hell would he
get to Gravesend and back

937
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:00,681
on his own without me knowing?

938
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:02,321
He in't in Gravesend.

939
00:45:02,441 --> 00:45:03,401
Royce.

940
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:05,361
He got transferred
to Sheffield.

941
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:08,121
When?

942
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:09,681
18 months, two years ago.

943
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:10,801
Didn't you know?

944
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:13,521
Why would I, Mike?

945
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:14,881
I thought there were
a court order in place

946
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:17,121
to stop him having any contact
with either you or Ryan.

947
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:18,801
So it doesn't matter
where he is.

948
00:45:18,921 --> 00:45:20,761
Yeah, there was,
and I renewed it.

949
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:23,481
I mean, it might have lapsed
again by now because, I mean,

950
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:25,841
it's been, God, how long?
Seven years?

951
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:28,001
But that's because I didn't
think I needed to renew it.

952
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:29,561
He never mentions him,
thank God.

953
00:45:29,681 --> 00:45:30,881
He never even thinks about him.

954
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:33,321
I can't remember the last time
he mentioned him.

955
00:45:33,441 --> 00:45:35,401
I think she's just...
Whatever she's heard,

956
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:38,361
I think she's just...wrong.

957
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:42,321
Can you ask him?

958
00:45:42,441 --> 00:45:43,761
No, no, no.

959
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:46,121
No, I'm not doing that.

960
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:51,441
- She say owt else?
- No.

961
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:54,361
I don't... Oh, only that he was
with a man and a woman.

962
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:55,601
A man and a woman?

963
00:45:55,721 --> 00:45:56,801
He'd have to be.

964
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,081
Any kid would have to be
if they're under 18.

965
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:01,841
What man?

966
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:03,321
And what woman?

967
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,561
They'll have a record of
his visiting orders

968
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:07,961
- at the prison, Mike.
- They will.

969
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:11,081
I'll find out who the governor
is and drop him an email.

970
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,161
Don't hold your breath.

971
00:46:13,281 --> 00:46:15,441
Prison Service are
worse staffed than we are.

972
00:46:15,561 --> 00:46:17,801
Can't be that far off
Royce's court date

973
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:20,081
for that Gary Gackowski murder,
can it?

974
00:46:20,201 --> 00:46:22,641
Next week. Right. Off you pop.

975
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:24,081
Look busy.

976
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,121
I'll give you a shout
if I hear owt.

977
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:29,361
And don't worry about it,
Catherine.

978
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:34,001
Like you say,
it'll be Chinese whispers.

979
00:46:50,801 --> 00:46:52,601
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

980
00:46:52,721 --> 00:46:56,001
Buenos dias.
Mi coche esté danado.

981
00:46:56,121 --> 00:46:57,961
<i>Perdén,
no lo entiendo.</i>

982
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,921
<i>Podria repetirlo, por favor?</i>

983
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:03,641
Perdén, no lo entiendo.

984
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:09,081
<i>Podflas repefiflo, pot favor'?</i>

985
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,601
<i>Dénde esté el taller mecénico
més cercano?</i>

986
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:28,641
So I went straight back
to our house

987
00:47:28,761 --> 00:47:31,081
and went into his bedroom.
I didn't find anything.

988
00:47:31,201 --> 00:47:32,961
Well, what did you expect
to find?

989
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:34,361
Letter?

990
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:35,721
Visiting order?

991
00:47:35,841 --> 00:47:37,001
I think...

992
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:39,801
...it's unlikely, Catherine.

993
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:41,281
Yeah, I know.
But suddenly Royce

994
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,001
is in Sheffield,
which I never knew,

995
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,241
and there's this man and
this woman taking him there,

996
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:46,641
or taking someone there.

997
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:49,921
Happen he's got other kids,

998
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,321
I don't know, but I'm still
left thinking things.

999
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:55,761
Wouldn't be Daniel and Ann

1000
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:57,881
because she won't go anywhere
near him any more than I would.

1001
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,121
It's not you and Ros.

1002
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:01,641
Definitely not me and Ros.

1003
00:48:01,761 --> 00:48:03,801
Clare and Neil have taken him
to watch football matches

1004
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:05,441
when I've been working, but...

1005
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:08,121
See, Neil,
I don't know about Neil.

1006
00:48:08,241 --> 00:48:09,361
I've never been sure
about Neil,

1007
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:10,481
but Clare, she just wouldn't.

1008
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:11,921
She wouldn't do that to me,
would she?

1009
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,321
- No. No.
- No.

1010
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:15,201
I don't... No.

1011
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:17,041
So then I'm thinking, well,
maybe Cesco's mum

1012
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:18,201
and some fella that she knows,

1013
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:20,281
but then why the hell
would they?

1014
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:22,721
Or some teacher, but then...

1015
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,881
...why? And the ethics,
they just...

1016
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,681
...wouldn't,
and I don't know anybody else.

1017
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:30,081
There's Nev.

1018
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:32,561
Nev takes him to see
Man City play now and again

1019
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:34,841
- but Nev would never...
- Never in a million years

1020
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:36,281
would Nev do that.

1021
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:37,921
Any more than Ann would.

1022
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,321
Yeah, so I don't know.
Don't know.

1023
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:46,041
- What's going on with Ros?
- Oh...

1024
00:48:50,001 --> 00:48:52,001
She's sleeping in
the spare room.

1025
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:54,721
I'm sorry.

1026
00:48:54,841 --> 00:48:56,881
Mm.

1027
00:49:04,201 --> 00:49:06,081
Nev's asked me out
for a meal.

1028
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:08,161
<i>Nev?</i>

1029
00:49:09,801 --> 00:49:11,241
Rang me after
Ryan's birthday tea.

1030
00:49:11,361 --> 00:49:13,201
You're not jealous, are you?

1031
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:14,521
I mean...

1032
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:17,281
...you know, good luck.

1033
00:49:18,801 --> 00:49:21,041
He's old enough
to be your grandad, but...

1034
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:22,081
Hardly.

1035
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:23,641
How old do you reckon he is?
70?

1036
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:25,481
Easily.

1037
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:27,361
75?

1038
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:30,761
76, 77?

1039
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:33,361
Does Ann know?

1040
00:49:33,481 --> 00:49:35,361
- Does Daniel?
- It wouldn't be illegal.

1041
00:49:35,481 --> 00:49:37,121
No. Just...

1042
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,721
What?

1043
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:41,961
"Tell me, Catherine,
what first attracted you

1044
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:43,041
"to the millionaire

1045
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:44,641
- "Nevison Gallagher?"
- Fuck off.

1046
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:46,361
See, you're smiling.

1047
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,681
Ask him.

1048
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:52,001
Ask Ryan straight out
about this other business.

1049
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:56,881
No.

1050
00:49:57,001 --> 00:49:58,321
Why?

1051
00:49:59,841 --> 00:50:01,481
Because I don't want
to put ideas in his head

1052
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,921
that he can visit him
if they're not there already.

1053
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:34,961
After you, love.

1054
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:39,641
Can I help?

1055
00:50:39,761 --> 00:50:42,881
Er, me cousin, he needs to
see the pharmacist about, er...

1056
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:45,521
Personal.

1057
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:48,521
Mr Bhatti?

1058
00:50:50,521 --> 00:50:51,481
Yeah?

1059
00:50:51,601 --> 00:50:52,761
This man's cousin needs...

1060
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:54,761
His English ain't great.

1061
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:57,401
But he's been with this lass

1062
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,801
and he thinks
he's picked summat up.

1063
00:50:59,921 --> 00:51:03,561
It's a bit swollen
and there's, like, discharge.

1064
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:10,281
But he's not registered
with t'surgery, so...

1065
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,121
OK. Er...

1066
00:51:12,241 --> 00:51:13,961
Do you want to just
come through here?

1067
00:51:14,081 --> 00:51:15,361
This way. Come on.

1068
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:22,921
You go on, love. I'm just
waiting for me cousin.

1069
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,761
Sit down.

1070
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,841
I can give you something
to ease the symptoms, but...

1071
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:28,601
Whoa!

1072
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:31,161
I've heard you've started
helping people, Faisal.

1073
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:32,761
Which is fine.

1074
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,121
Only trouble is, we run
these postcodes round here,

1075
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:37,081
- not you. Do you understand?
- Yeah.

1076
00:51:37,201 --> 00:51:38,801
Yeah, that's fine.
I was starting to think

1077
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:40,681
I'd bitten off more than
I could chew, anyway.

1078
00:51:40,801 --> 00:51:41,961
Yeah, but...

1079
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:44,561
Good, but the thing is,

1080
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:46,881
we still need you to keep on
doing what you're doing.

1081
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:48,161
So when you collect
your winnings,

1082
00:51:48,281 --> 00:51:49,561
you'll be handing them over
to us, OK?

1083
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:51,761
No, I won't. I can't.

1084
00:51:51,881 --> 00:51:53,161
- I can't.
- You will.

1085
00:51:53,281 --> 00:51:55,961
I can't do it any more because
the police might be onto me.

1086
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:58,641
Well, till we know
one way or the other,

1087
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:01,281
we'll stick with the
arrangement, do you understand?

1088
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:02,601
We know you're turning over

1089
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:04,001
- upwards of 1,800 quid a week.
- No!

1090
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,081
Yeah, you are.
So don't short-change me.

1091
00:52:07,201 --> 00:52:09,521
It's not that much!
It's only ever about 1,000

1092
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:10,521
- at the most.
- Well, why don't you

1093
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:11,521
make up the difference, then?

1094
00:52:11,641 --> 00:52:12,841
You can do a bit more
easy enough.

1095
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:15,201
I've told you, the police
might be onto me.

1096
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:16,921
Don't worry about t'po
ice.

1097
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:18,881
What do you mean?

1098
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:21,481
I mean it's me you need to
worry about now.

1099
00:52:21,601 --> 00:52:22,641
We know where your Maira

1100
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:24,881
and your little...little Haniya
go to school.

1101
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:27,761
Been watching 'em.

1102
00:52:27,881 --> 00:52:30,401
We know what time they leave,
we know what bus they get on.

1103
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:32,681
We know whose houses they go to
at dinner times when they're

1104
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:33,921
- meant to be in school.
- Who's we?

1105
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,361
Eh, we probably know more about

1106
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:36,881
what they get up to
than you do.

1107
00:52:38,881 --> 00:52:40,481
Listen, Faisal.

1108
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:42,401
Nobody wants to see 'em
get hurt, hmm?

1109
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:44,801
Nobody wants to see anybody
get abducted

1110
00:52:44,921 --> 00:52:46,641
and treated like bitches.

1111
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:47,881
Yeah?

1112
00:52:49,321 --> 00:52:50,401
I don't.

1113
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:54,521
So don't you worry about
t'po
ice. All right?

1114
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,761
We'll worry about the police.
Yeah?

1115
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:58,801
We'll see you
in a couple of days.

1116
00:52:58,921 --> 00:53:00,081
No! That's...

1117
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:01,721
Oh, is that not convenient?

1118
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:03,641
Mm? Mm?

1119
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:06,161
It's convenient for me.

1120
00:53:08,761 --> 00:53:10,721
Better go get me
a little box of

1121
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:12,641
whatever it is
you're going to give me.

1122
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:16,001
Don't want your little girl out
there thinking things, do we?

1123
00:53:29,361 --> 00:53:31,961
He's to come back
and see you again

1124
00:53:32,081 --> 00:53:33,921
in a couple of days, yeah?

1125
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:38,841
Nice one.

1126
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:21,201
I rang the MHRA
to see if anyone

1127
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:23,561
knew anything about
the illegal supply of diazepam

1128
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:26,041
in and around Elland.

1129
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:28,681
Their PLO's just rung me back
and said, "Yeah, we're aware

1130
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:31,161
"there's a problem and there is
an ongoing inquiry."

1131
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:33,641
- Knezevics?
- No doubt.

1132
00:54:33,761 --> 00:54:36,161
Yeah, the ever-lovely
Knezevics.

1133
00:54:37,401 --> 00:54:39,041
The Teflon-coated Knezevics.

1134
00:54:39,161 --> 00:54:41,001
I should have said, "Right,
you take your time, love,

1135
00:54:41,121 --> 00:54:43,441
"we'll just mop up as usual."

1136
00:54:45,801 --> 00:54:46,841
What?

1137
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:53,081
I've got some intel for you
from the prison in Sheffield.

1138
00:54:56,081 --> 00:54:57,361
You're not going to like it.
