# Hardware decoding for whatever your CPU/GPU supports (e.g. 8bit h264 / 10bit h265)
# Only should be used when your CPU/GPU are very old, else avoid using it
# Use "auto-copy-safe" for the safest result in trade of better performance

# Video ===========================================================================================

profile=gpu-hq                          # Lazy quality profile which sets some recommended settings

# All of the settings can be found further down in the guide
# Setting the profile is not needed, but it doesn't hurt.
# You can overwrite the settings without any issue
# Here is a list of the settings "gpu-hq" sets:
# * scale=spline36
# * cscale=spline36
# * dscale=mitchell
# * dither-depth=auto
# * correct-downscaling=yes
# * linear-downscaling=yes
# * sigmoid-upscaling=yes
# * deband=yes

# // Dither 
dither-depth=auto                       # Falls back to 8 bit if output bit depth can't be detected

# // Deband
# Note: Set it to "no" if you rather handle it with profiles or a key (recommended)
# Debanding videos where it isn't needed can result in detail loss
# Recommended settings for anime:
# * 2:35:20:5 	- General
# * 3:45:25:15	- Older DVD, badly mastered BD or WEB streams
# * 4:60:30:30	- Low quality streams or extreme loss of quality
deband=no                               # Activate debanding
deband-iterations=4                     # Steps (More = Better quality, higher GPU cost)
deband-threshold=48                     # Strength (More = Less banding, more detail loss)
deband-range=16                         # Range (More = Less banding, higher GPU cost)
deband-grain=24                         # Dynamic Grain (More = More dynamic grain)
                                        # Set 0 if using static grain shader [Line 183]

# // Anti-Ringing
scale-antiring=0.7                      # Luma upscale (Higher = Less ringing, more detail loss)
dscale-antiring=0.7                     # Luma downscale (Higher = Less ringing, more detail loss)
cscale-antiring=0.7                     # Chroma upscale (Higher = Less ringing, more detail loss)

# // Interpolation
# Note: See https://github.com/haasn/interpolation-samples for how interpolation should look in mpv
interpolation=no                        # Activate interpolation

# Note: From sharpest to smoothest [oversample, linear, catmull_rom, mitchell, gaussian, bicubic]

# ! EXPERIMENTAL !
#tscale=sphinx

# THIS OPTION HAS NO EFFECT WITH "vo=gpu"

# Shaders =========================================================================================

# Scaling =========================================================================================

# See https://artoriuz.github.io/blog/mpv_upscaling.html for a detailed comparison among scalers

# Note: If you have a 1440p monitor, some shaders such as FSRCNNX will only upscale at a certain
# threshold for 1080p media e.g for FSRCNNX, replace all instances of 1.400 with 1.300 in the glsl

#linear-downscaling=yes                 # Light downscaling method
linear-upscaling=yes                    # Light upscaling method
sigmoid-upscaling=yes                   # Creates less ringing and better results overall
correct-downscaling=yes                 # Extend filter size when downscaling with convolution
                                        # filters. Increases quality, less performance.

# // Luma Up
# Note: ML based shaders e.g FSRCNNX, RAVU, nnedi3 are best for accuracy but requires more compute
# power where as generic algorithms e.g FSR/Nvidia aims to provide satisfying results with far less
# resources. FSR/Nvidia sharpness and other params can be adjusted by editing the glsl file itself
#glsl-shader="~~/shaders/FSRCNNX_x2_16-0-4-1.glsl"      # Most accurate, diminishing returns
#glsl-shader="~~/shaders/FSRCNNX_x2_8-0-4-1.glsl"       # Generally accurate, high gpu consumption
#glsl-shader="~~/shaders/FSR.glsl"                       # Great perceived quality w/ sharpener

# // Luma Down
# Note: If downscaling factor is >= 2x (e.g 4k to 1080p) use SSIMDownscaler w/ dscale=mitchell
#glsl-shader="~~/shaders/SSimDownscaler.glsl"
linear-downscaling=no
dscale=lanczos                          # mitchell = anti-ringing, lanczos = perceived sharpness

# // Chroma Up + Down
# Note: Chroma subsampling means that chroma information is encoded at lower resolution than luma
# In MPV, chroma is upscaled to luma resolution (video size) and then the converted RGB is upscaled
# to target resolution (screen size).

# Perceived quality is negligible so only use a heavy scaler if you don't mind the performance cost
# for ultimate quality. I use lanczos here because sigmoid-upscaling theoretically dampens ringing
# artifacts when upscaling video and I mainly consume 1080p content
#glsl-shader="~~/shaders/KrigBilateral.glsl"
cscale=lanczos                          # mitchell = anti-ringing, lanczos = perceived sharpness
